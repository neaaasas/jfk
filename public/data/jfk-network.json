          "Lead": "Dean Adams Andrews Jr. (October 8, 1922 – April 15, 1981)[1] was an attorney in New Orleans, Louisiana. During the trial of Clay Shaw, he was questioned by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison regarding his Warren Commission testimony in which he had mentioned a man named Clay Bertrand having called him shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy asking him to represent Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas, Texas. In August, 1967 Andrews was convicted on three counts of perjury for lying to a grand jury in his previous testimony.",
          "Warren Commission testimony": "On November 25, 1963, Andrews informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that three days earlier (on the day of the assassination of President Kennedy) he received a telephone call from a Clay Bertrand who asked him whether he would be willing to represent Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin.[2][3] Andrews subsequently repeated his claim regarding the phone call in testimony before the Warren Commission in July 1964.[4] Andrews described Bertrand as a \"swinging cat\" (what Andrews defined as a bisexual) who occasionally guaranteed fees for some of Andrews' homosexual clients.[5]\n\nTwo weeks after the assassination, the FBI reported that Andrews had admitted that Bertrand was a \"figment of his imagination\". The FBI report stated that Andrews had been hospitalized at the time with pneumonia and was under heavy sedation.[6] However, Andrews would later deny the FBI report, claiming that he had never suggested that Bertrand might not be real.[7]\n\nA Secret Service report issued in December 1963, two weeks after the assassination of President Kennedy, stated that Andrews said that Lee Harvey Oswald had visited Andrews' office on approximately three occasions in June and July 1963, seeking legal advice from Andrews concerning his citizenship status, his wife's status and his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps.[3] Andrews described his encounters with Oswald in testimony before the Warren Commission in July 1964.[8]",
          "Trial of Clay Shaw": "In the spring of 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison — who over the course of several months had been investigating the assassination of President Kennedy — asserted that Clay Bertrand was actually New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw. Garrison alleged that Shaw used the alias Clay Bertrand among New Orleans' gay society.[9][10] Garrison further believed that Shaw and a group of right-wing activists, including David Ferrie and Guy Banister, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the Kennedy assassination.[11][12] Garrison arrested Shaw on March 1, 1967.[13][14] Shaw was booked on conspiracy to commit murder, but denied that he had ever used the name Clay Bertrand.[14] Shaw was eventually acquitted of the charges.\n\nAndrews contradicted his testimony before the Warren Commission when, after appearing before the Orleans Parish grand jury, he stated in an interview on June 28, 1967 that Bertrand was not Shaw but was Eugene Davis, his friend and client.[15] Davis denied in an affidavit that he was Bertrand or the person who suggested that Andrews go to Dallas to help Oswald.[16] Andrews was subsequently convicted on three counts of perjury for lying to the grand jury on August 14, 1967.[17] On February 25, 1969, Andrews testified during the trial of Clay Shaw that the name \"Clay Bertrand was a figment of [his] imagination\" and that he had been \"carrying on a farce\" in order to prevent \"bring[ing] a lot of heat and trouble to someone who didn't deserve it.\"[18]",

          "Lead": "William Guy Banister (March 7, 1901 – June 6, 1964) was an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), an assistant superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, and a private investigator. After his death, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison alleged that he had been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He was an avid anti-communist, alleged member of the Minutemen, the John Birch Society, Louisiana Committee on Un-American Activities, and alleged publisher of the Louisiana Intelligence Digest which maintained that the civil rights movement was part of an international communist conspiracy and was treasonous.\n\nHe also supported anti-Castro groups in the New Orleans area: \"Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front\"; \"Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean\"; \"Friends of Democratic Cuba\".[1] According to the New Orleans States-Item newspaper, Banister \"participated in every anti-Communist South and Central American revolution that came along, acting as a key liaison man for the U.S. government-sponsored anti-Communist activities in Latin America.\"[2]",
          "Early life and law enforcement career": "Banister was born in Monroe, Louisiana, the oldest of seven children. He later became a Freemason and a Shriner. After studying at the Louisiana State University, he joined the Monroe Police Department.[3][4] In 1934, Banister joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was present at the killing of John Dillinger. Originally based in Indianapolis, he later moved to New York City where he was involved in the investigation of the American Communist Party. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was impressed by Banister's work and, in 1938, he was promoted to run the FBI unit in Butte, Montana. In December 1944, Banister was charged with investigating a fatal Fu-Go balloon bomb near Kalispell, Montana.[5] During the 1947 flying disc craze, Banister investigated a hoaxed saucer in Twin Falls.[6]\n\nHe also served in Oklahoma City, Minneapolis and Chicago. In Chicago, he was the Special Agent in Charge for the FBI.[4] He retired from the FBI in 1954. Banister moved to Louisiana and, in January 1955, became Assistant Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, where he was given the task of investigating organized crime and corruption within the police force. It later emerged that he was also involved in looking at the role that left-wing political activists were playing in the struggle for civil rights in New Orleans.[7] On the campuses of Tulane University and Louisiana State University, he ran a network of informants collecting information on \"communist\" activities. He submitted reports on his findings to the FBI through contacts.[8] In December 1955, Banister publicly revealed 91 members of the police who were involved in graft, after a list was found at the home of an illegal lottery operator.[9]\n\nIn March 1957, NOPD Superintendent Provosty Dayries suspended Banister after witnesses reported he had drawn his revolver while threatening a bartender at the Old Absinthe House on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter.[10][11] Banister denied the allegations, and the bartender described the incident as an \"unprovoked attack\".[12] Later in March, Banister appeared before the state's Joint Legislative Segregation Committee where he told investigators that he had \"documentary proof of clear and specific communist directions to promote friction between the races\". He also told of investigating the first Japanese fire balloon to land in the US.[13] Banister's suspension ended in June of that year; however, Dayries dismissed Banister from the force for \"open defiance\" after he refused to be reassigned as the department's chief of planning.[14][15] In supporting Dayries' decision, New Orleans' mayor Chep Morrison said that there was \"no other course that one could sensibly follow\".[15]",
          "Private investigation, Cuba, Oswald, Marcello": "After leaving the New Orleans Police Department, Banister established his own private detective agency, Guy Banister Associates, Inc. at 434 Balter Building.[16] In June 1960, Banister moved his office to 531 Lafayette Street on the ground floor of the Newman Building.[16] Around the corner but located in the same building, with a different entrance, was the address 544 Camp Street, which would later be found stamped on Fair Play for Cuba Committee leaflets distributed by Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F. Kennedy.[17] The Newman Building housed militant anti-Castro groups, including the Cuban Revolutionary Council (October 1961 to February 1962), as well as Sergio Arcacha Smith's Crusade to Free Cuba Committee.[18]\n\nBanister was implicated in a 1961 raid on a munitions depot in Houma, Louisiana, in which \"various weapons, grenades and ammunition were stolen ... which were reportedly seen stacked in Banister's back room by several witnesses.\"[8] The New Orleans States-Item newspaper reported an allegation that Banister served as a munitions supplier for the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and continued to deal weapons from his office until 1963.[19]\n\nIn 1962, Banister allegedly dispatched an associate, Maurice Brooks Gatlin — legal counsel of Banister's \"Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean\" — to Paris to deliver a suitcase containing $200,000 for the French OAS. In 1963, Banister and anti-Castro activist David Ferrie began working for a lawyer named G. Wray Gill and his client, New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. This involved attempts to block Marcello's deportation to Guatemala.[8][20] In early 1962, Banister assisted David Ferrie in a dispute with Eastern Airlines regarding charges brought against Ferrie by the airline and New Orleans police of \"crimes against nature and extortion.\"[8] During this period, Ferrie was frequently seen at Banister's office.[21] Banister served as a character witness for Ferrie at his airline pilot's grievance board hearing in the summer of 1963.[21][8]",
          "JFK assassination and trial of Clay Shaw": "On the afternoon of November 22, 1963, the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Banister and one of his investigators, Jack Martin, were drinking together at the Katzenjammer Bar, located next door to 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. On their return to Banister's office, the two men got into a dispute. Banister believed that Martin had stolen some files and drew his .357 Magnum revolver, striking Martin with it several times. Martin was badly injured and treated at Charity Hospital. When questioned about the incident in December 1977 by investigators for the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), Martin said that in the heat of the argument just prior to the pistol-whipping he had said to Banister: \"What are you going to do — kill me like you all did Kennedy?\"[22]\n\nOver the next few days, Martin told authorities and reporters that anti-Castro activist David Ferrie had been involved in the assassination. He claimed that Ferrie knew Oswald from their days in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol, and that Ferrie might have taught Oswald how to use a rifle with a telescopic sight.[23] Martin also claimed that Ferrie drove to Texas on the day of Kennedy's assassination, to serve as a getaway pilot for the assassins.[24] Witnesses interviewed by the HSCA indicate Banister was \"aware of Oswald and his Fair Play for Cuba Committee before the assassination.\"[25]\n\nBanister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, told author Anthony Summers that Oswald \"seemed to be on familiar terms with Banister and with [Banister's] office.\" Roberts said, \"As I understood it, he had the use of an office on the second floor, above the main office where we worked. Then, several times, Mr. Banister brought me upstairs, and in the office above I saw various writings stuck up on the wall pertaining to Cuba. There were various leaflets up there pertaining to Fair Play for Cuba.'\"[26] The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated Roberts' claims and said that \"the reliability of her statements could not be determined.\"[27]\n\nThe alleged activities of Banister, Ferrie and Oswald reached New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison who, by late 1966, had become interested in the New Orleans aspects of the assassination. In December 1966, Garrison interviewed Martin about these activities. Martin claimed that Banister, Ferrie and a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles were involved in operations against Castro's Cuba that included gun running and burglarized armories.[28]\n\nAs Garrison continued his investigation, he became convinced that a group of right-wing activists, including Banister, Ferrie and Clay Shaw, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to kill Kennedy. Garrison would later claim that the motive for the assassination was anger over Kennedy's attempts to obtain a peace settlement in both Cuba and Vietnam.[29][30] Garrison also believed that Banister, Shaw, and Ferrie had conspired to set up Oswald as a patsy in the JFK assassination.[31]",
          "Death": "Banister died of coronary thrombosis on June 6, 1964.[32] Banister's files went to various people after his death.[33] Later, New Orleans Assistant District Attorney Andrew Sciambra interviewed Banister's widow. She told him that she saw some Fair Play for Cuba leaflets in Banister's office when she went there after his death.[34]",
          "Fictional portrayals": "Banister is a character in Oliver Stone's 1991 movie JFK, in which he is portrayed by Edward Asner.[35] He is also central to the plot of Don DeLillo's novel Libra. Banister appears as a character in James Ellroy's 1995 novel American Tabloid and its sequel The Cold Six Thousand. In American Tabloid, Banister organizes John Kennedy's assassination, which is based on Ward Littell's original plan. In The Cold Six Thousand, Banister is murdered by Chuck Rogers under orders from Carlos Marcello.\n\n^ \"XIII. 544 Camp Street and Related Events\".

          "Biography": "Born in Paris, Texas, Baxter graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1950. He then attended the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas where he received his medical degree in 1954.[1]\n\nBaxter was the emergency room director at Parkland Memorial Hospital when Kennedy was shot, and famously said of the event in 1988:\n\nAs soon as we realized we had nothing medical to do, we all backed off from the man with a reverence that one has for one's president, and we did not continue to be doctors from that point on. We became citizens again, and there were probably more tears shed in that room than in the surrounding hundred miles.[2]\n\nHe also operated on Texas Governor John Connally, who had been wounded in the attack.[2]\n\nBaxter made advances in the treatment of burn victims, and founded the burn unit[citation needed] and a skin-graft bank at Parkland.[2] The Parkland formula for fluids is attributed to him.\n\nHe died in Dallas, Texas, on March 10, 2005, of pneumonia, aged 75.[1]\n\nParkland formula\n\nParkland formula\n\n^\na b \"Charles Baxter Obituary\".

He had many celebrity clients, including Zsa Zsa Gabor, Errol Flynn, Chuck Berry, Muhammad Ali, The Rolling Stones, Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye Bakker, Martha Mitchell, Maureen Connolly, Lana Turner, Tony Curtis, and Mae West. During his legal career, he won over $600 million in damages for his clients.[4][better source needed] He was also the attorney for Jack Ruby, who shot Lee Harvey Oswald days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.",
          "Early life": "Belli was born in the California Gold Rush town of Sonora, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills.[5] His parents were of Italian ancestry from Switzerland.[6] His grandmother, Anna Mouron, was the first female pharmacist in California. By the 1920s, the family had moved to the Central Valley city of Stockton, California, where Belli attended the now-defunct Stockton High School.\n\nBelli graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1929. After traveling around the world, he returned to the U.C. Berkeley School of Law from which he earned his law degree in 1933.[7][8]",
          "Career": "Following his admission to the California bar, his first job was posing as a hobo for the Works Progress Administration and riding the rails to observe the Depression's impact on the country's vagrant population.\n\nHis first major legal victory came shortly after graduation, in a personal injury lawsuit representing an injured cable car gripman. Over insurance lawyers' objections, Belli brought a model of a cable car intersection, and the gear box and chain involved in the accident, to demonstrate to jurors exactly what had happened.[9]\n\nBesides his personal injury cases, which earned for him his byname \"King of Torts,\"[5][3] Belli was instrumental in setting up some of the foundations of modern consumer rights law, arguing several cases in the 1940s and 1950s that formed the basis for later lawsuits and landmark litigation by Ralph Nader.\n\nIn Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. (1944),, where a restaurant waitress from Merced, California, was injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle, Belli argued that all products have an implied warranty, that it is to be foreseen that products will be used by a long chain of people and not just the direct recipient of the manufactured product, and that negligence by a defendant need not be proven if the defendant's product is defective. Thus was born the doctrine of strict liability in product defect causes of action.\n\nIn his book Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli notes legal cases of negligence cited by personal-injury attorneys, like himself, to win in court. Examples include a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls, forbidden by the municipal code because of the effect of the ocean salt and air. The facing was a slab of vitreous marble, whose adhesion was weakened by the climate; it fell off the side of the building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder.\n\nAfter winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.[10]\n\nIn his best-known case, Belli represented Jack Ruby, pro bono, after Ruby shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald. Belli attempted to prove that Ruby was legally insane and had a history of mental illness in his family. On Saturday, March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of \"murder with malice,\" and received a death sentence.\n\nImmediately thereafter, Ruby and his siblings fired Belli as they had hired and fired several other attorneys during the case. In late 1966, Ruby's conviction was overturned on the grounds that he did not receive a fair trial. A retrial was scheduled outside of Dallas, but Ruby died of cancer before it could take place. Belli became very critical of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.[11]\n\nIn 1969 a man called San Francisco police, identifying himself as the serial killer known only as The Zodiac, and agreed to call talk show host Jim Dunbar on Dunbar's morning television talk show A.M. San Francisco if either Belli or attorney F. Lee Bailey were present on air. The police contacted Belli and Dunbar to arrange this in the hopes of capturing the individual. As promised, the suspect called, spoke a few words, and then hung up, repeating this activity 54 times over the next two hours.[12] Belli received a letter from the Zodiac that same year.[13]\n\nBelli's firm filed for bankruptcy protection in December 1995. Belli was representing 800 women in a class action lawsuit against breast implant manufacturer Dow Corning. Belli won the lawsuit, but when Dow Corning declared bankruptcy, Belli had no way to recover the $5 million his firm had advanced to doctors and expert witnesses.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1960s, Belli was among the leading members of the California plaintiffs bar who helped establish the California Trial Lawyers Association, which in the mid-1990s was renamed the Consumer Attorneys of California. The organization was established to help set standards and foment on-going legal education to help consumers have a better chance in court against the powerful legal teams amassed by the insurance companies and big corporations that typically were the defendants in accident, personal injury and other consumer lawsuits.[14]",
          "In media": "Belli was the executive producer of Tokyo File 212 (1951), Hollywood's first film to be shot entirely in Japan.[15] It featured Florence Marly and Robert Peyton in key roles.[16]\n\nBelli enjoyed his frequent television and movie appearances; in 1965, he told Alex Haley, interviewing him for Playboy, that he \"might have been an actor\" if he had not become an attorney.[citation needed]\n\nBelli appeared in \"And the Children Shall Lead\", a 1968 episode of the original Star Trek series. In it he appears as \"Gorgan, the Friendly Angel\", an evil being who corrupts a group of children, one of whom was played by his son Caesar.[17]\n\nHe appeared in the Albert and David Maysles documentary Gimme Shelter (1970), which featured his representation and facilitation of The Rolling Stones' staging of the disastrous December 6, 1969, Altamont Free Concert.\n\nIn 1986 he played a criminal defense lawyer in an episode of the TV series Hunter titled \"True Confessions\".[4][better source needed]\n\nIn 1996 Belli recited the oratory to David Woodard's brass fanfare setting of Mark Twain's \"The War Prayer\" at Old First Church in San Francisco.[18]\n\nBelli was played by Brian Cox in the 2007 film Zodiac in the scene that depicted Belli's conversation with the Zodiac suspect on A.M. San Francisco.[13]\n\nBig Black guitarist Santiago Durango used Belli's name as a pseudonym in the credits of the last Big Black studio album, Songs About Fucking, as a nod to the fact that Durango was going to attend law school after Big Black disbanded.",
          "Author": "Belli was the author of several books, including the six-volume Modern Trials (written between 1954 and 1960) which has become a classic textbook on the demonstrative method of presenting evidence. Belli's unprecedented — and some thought undignified [who?] — use of graphic evidence and expert witnesses later became common courtroom practice. His autobiography My Life on Trial is an account of his life and the noteworthy events he was involved in during his career. He also wrote the introduction to 847.0 The Whiplash Injury by L. Ted Frigard, D.C. published in 1970. Dr. Frigard had helped Belli with his pain through chiropractic care. With John Carlova, Belli also wrote the book \"Belli For Your Malpractice Defense\" to advise doctors how to avoid legal problems. [19]",
          "Personal life": "Belli was married six times and divorced five.[5] His marriage to his fifth wife, the former Lia Georgia Triff, ended with a scandalous and acrimonious divorce proceeding in 1991. Belli accused his ex-wife of having an affair with archbishop Desmond Tutu and of throwing one of his dogs off the Golden Gate Bridge. He was fined $1,000 for repeatedly calling her \"El Trampo\". At one point, Belli was ejected from the courtroom after accusing the judge of sleeping with his former wife's lawyer.[20] He was ultimately compelled to pay her an estimated $15 million. She later married Romanian prince Prince Paul of Romania. Belli married his sixth wife, Nancy Ho, on March 29, 1996.[5] His youngest child, Melia, from fifth wife Lia, became an art history scholar, and is currently an assistant professor of Asian art history at the University of Texas at Arlington.[21]",
          "Death": "Belli died of complications from pancreatic cancer at his home in San Francisco on July 9, 1996, aged 88.[5] His death came suddenly, and in the presence of his wife Nancy.[3] The New York Times' quoted his publicist Edward Lozzi: \"He was sitting; he just stopped breathing\".[22] At the time of his death, he had three sons, three daughters, twelve grandchildren, and two dogs.[5] He was remembered as, \"an impresario of a lawyer who pioneered new techniques and huge settlements in personal injury cases and who defended Jack Ruby, the man who killed Lee Harvey Oswald.\"[23][24] He is buried in Odd Fellows Cemetery in Sonora, California, his birthplace.[3] He is remembered as one of the \"most famous lawyers in America.\"[3]",

          "Lead": "Carlos Jose Bringuier (born June 22, 1934)[1] is a Cuban exile in the United States who campaigned against Fidel Castro's government. Bringuier is principally known for his brief connection with Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of US President John F. Kennedy.",
          "Early life": "Bringuier was born in Cuba[1] and studied at the University of Havana where he qualified as a lawyer in 1957. As an opponent of Fidel Castro and his government, he left Cuba on May 4, 1960 and moved to Guatemala; he also lived in Argentina for a brief time before arriving in the United States on February 8, 1961.[1] He set up home in New Orleans, and opened a clothing store called \"Casa Roca\".[2]",
          "Encounter with Oswald": "Bringuier joined the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil, the Student Revolutionary Directorate (DRE), an anti-Castro group. Bringuier was made New Orleans delegate,[2][3] and placed in charge of DRE publicity and propaganda.[4] Bringuier's clothing store in New Orleans became the local headquarters for anti-Castro Cubans. On August 5, 1963, according to Bringuier, Lee Oswald visited him at his store and posed as a friend of the Cuban exiles, offering to join the fight against Castro.[5] The next day, Oswald again visited the store and left his Guidebook for Marines for the absent Bringuier.[5] Bringuier testified to the Warren Commission that he was uninterested in Oswald's offer.[2][6]\n\nOn August 9, 1963, Oswald was spotted by Celso Hernandez (a friend of Bringuier) handing out pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba leaflets at the intersection of Canal Street and St. Charles. Hernandez told Bringuier of Oswald's leafleting and the two of them, along with another anti-Castro militant, Miguel Cruz, decided to confront Oswald over his duplicity. As the Cubans accosted Oswald, a crowd began to gather. Bringuier attempted to incite the crowd with his story that Oswald had tried to join his anti-Castro movement and that Oswald was actually a communist and supporter of Castro.[5][7][8] Hernandez grabbed Oswald's leaflets and a fight broke out. Oswald and the three Cubans were arrested for disturbing the peace.[5][9][10] After the arrest, Bringuier and his Cuban friends were able to post bail, whereas Oswald's bond was posted by an Oswald family friend.[2] Oswald was found guilty, fined $10, and released.[11] Before leaving the police station, Oswald asked to speak with an FBI agent. Agent John Quigley arrived and spent over an hour talking to Oswald.[8][9][12]",
          "Radio broadcast": "To garner information on the New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Bringuier said that he sent his colleague Carlos Quiroga (who posed as a Castro sympathizer) to question Oswald.[12][13] Oswald had established the New Orleans chapter of the FPCC in May 1963 and was its sole member.[14][15]\n\nBringuier then called William Stuckey, a reporter who hosted a weekly radio program called \"Latin Listening Post\" on local station WDSU.[16] Bringuier informed Stuckey of Oswald's background and Stuckey went to see Oswald, persuading him to be interviewed on radio;[3][17] the interview was recorded on August 17.[citation needed]\n\nA few days later, Stuckey invited Oswald to take part in a radio debate with Bringuier and Edward Butler, executive director of the anti-Communist group Information Council of the Americas (INCA). The debate took place on August 21; both Stuckey and Butler had in the meantime discovered the story of Oswald's 1959 defection to the Soviet Union and confronted him with it.[18][19] During the debate, Bringuier challenged Oswald to agree with Fidel Castro's denunciation of President Kennedy as a ruffian and a thief.[20]\n\nBringuier was pleased with the result of the debate and issued a press release, warning the public about Oswald.[21] After Oswald was arrested for the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Bringuier gave his account of Oswald to the FBI and other authorities. He testified before the Warren Commission[22] and, in 1967, was involved in Jim Garrison's investigation of the assassination.[citation needed]",

          "Lead": "Madeleine Duncan Brown (July 5, 1925 – June 22, 2002) was an American woman who claimed to be a longtime mistress of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson.[2][3][4] In addition to claiming that a son was born out of that relationship, Brown also implicated Johnson in a conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.[2][3][4]",
          "Background": "Brown described her background in her 1997 autobiography, Texas in the Morning: The Love Story of Madeleine Brown and President Lyndon Baines Johnson.[5] According to Brown, she was raised in a middle-class Catholic household in Dallas, Texas, where her father was a utility company supervisor and her mother was a housewife.[2] She stated that she attended W. H. Adamson High School.[5] Brown said at the age of 19 she married James Glynn Brown, a childhood sweetheart and neighborhood soda jerk, whom she divorced in 1955.[2][5][6][7]\n\nShe described her husband as a veteran of the United States Marine Corps whose \"war experiences had shattered his nerves, and turned him into a hopeless, physically abusive drunkard\".[5] Brown said that he \"was eventually institutionalized in a veteran's hospital for 'chronic paranoid schizophrenia'\".[2][5] According to Brown, she left her husband in 1948 while he was in the hospital, returning to Dallas with her two-month-old son, Jimmy Glynn Brown.[2][6][7] She said that she was subsequently hired that same year by Glenn Advertising and was promoted to media buyer whose responsibilities including purchasing radio advertising time.[2][5]",
          "Initial allegations: affair with LBJ": "On November 5, 1982, Brown spoke at a news conference held at the Dallas Press Club, alleging that she had an extramarital relationship with Johnson for almost twenty years.[3][4] She said that the affair began in 1948 after a party at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas and lasted until 1967.[3][4] The Dallas Morning News also published the allegations under the headline \"Dallas Woman Claims She Was LBJ's Lover\", noting that spokespeople for Lady Bird Johnson and the Johnson family rejected the claims.[3][4] Brown's statement, in which she said she wanted to \"clear the record\", came three weeks after published reports of an affair between Johnson and Alice Glass.[3]",
          "Paternity suit filed": "On June 18, 1987, Brown's second son, Steven Mark Brown (December 27, 1950 – September 28, 1990), filed a $10.5 million lawsuit against Lady Bird Johnson in a Texas district court alleging that the former first lady and two friends of President Johnson, Jesse Kellam of Austin and Jerome T. Ragsdale of Dallas, had conspired to deprive him of a share of the Johnson estate.[6][7][nb 1] His suit claimed: \"My legal birthrights have been violated and a conspiracy was formed to deprive me of my legal heirship.\"[6][7] The suit included an affidavit from Madeleine Brown, alleging that she met President Johnson in 1948 at a social function within a Dallas hotel, then had an affair with him that lasted from 1948 until 1969.[6][7]\n\nAccording to her affidavit, Ragsdale, a deceased Dallas attorney, was assigned to assist with legal issues regarding her pregnancy and later claimed to be the child's father in order to shield Johnson from negative publicity.[6][7] Betty Tilson, the press secretary for Lady Bird Johnson, was quoted as stating: \"We're convinced the whole thing is made-up, frankly.\"[7] Tilson indicated that close associates of the Johnson family were not familiar with the name \"Steven Mark Brown\" nor was there any record of correspondence or visitation from him within the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.[7] She also stated that no one she talked to knew Ragsdale.[7]",
          "Interview with People magazine": "The August 5, 1987 issue of People magazine detailed additional claims made by Madeleine and Steven Brown.[2]\n\nIn the 1940s, the Johnsons owned a radio station in Austin, KTBC, run by Jesse Kellam.[2][8] Madeleine Brown claimed that she attended a KTBC reception in 1948 while working for a Dallas advertising agency and was introduced to Johnson through Kellam.[2] She reported that Johnson flirted with her during this initial encounter and that she was \"dazzled\" by him.[2] According to Brown, Kellam immediately asked her to another reception three weeks later at the Adolphus Hotel.[2]\n\nIt was at that meeting, she said, that her long affair with Johnson began after he invited her up to his apartment in the hotel.[2] Brown said that Johnson insisted the affair be kept secret, and she alleged that Kellam functioned as a go-between who arranged for Johnson and her to meet.[2] People magazine reported that she claimed her relationship with Johnson was \"purely physical\" and had discovered that he had other mistresses.[2] According to Brown, she told Johnson in April 1950 that she was pregnant and he assured her he would provide for her needs.[2]\n\nShe claimed that Kellam told her a few days later that she would be contacted by attorney Jerome Ragsdale.[2] Brown alleged that after the birth of Steven in 1950, Ragsdale provided her with \"a six-room house for $15,000, complete with a live-in maid\", and paid the various charge cards he supplied to her.[2] She said her physician told her that he would note her husband, James Glynn Brown, as the father.[2]\n\nAccording to Brown, she continued to meet with Johnson throughout the 1950s and 1960s.[2] She told People that for five years, at Kellam's urging, she had a \"paper marriage\" to a Dallas businessman with whom she never lived.[2] She said that years after they divorced, she was told by a friend that the man had committed suicide.[2] According to Brown, she was on her way to see Johnson in Austin when she heard about the assassination of Kennedy over the radio, then turned around.[2]\n\nShe said that a few weeks later Kellam instructed her to meet the new President of the United States in their usual place.[2] Brown told People that her sexual relationship with Johnson abruptly ended in 1967 after she was badly injured in a car accident in which her son, Steven, was at the wheel.[2] She said she had one last meeting with Johnson in 1969 at the Shamrock Hotel in Houston, Texas, in which they had a two-hour discussion which she described as their first \"real conversation\".[2] Brown said that in 1973 Kellam telephoned her to say that Johnson had died.[2]\n\nBrown stated that she was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack in February 1987 and, expecting to die, called Steven to her bedside in order to confess hiding the true identity of his father from him.[2] According to People, despite the name of his mother's first husband on his birth certificate, Steven had been \"wracked by uncertainty\" about who was his true father and \"had come to suspect a lawyer friend of the family was actually his father\".[2] Steven's mother said that she had no love letters from Johnson and that the few people who could corroborate her story were dead.[2]\n\nAccording to Brown, she came forward with the paternity claim to assist Steven in claiming his inheritance.[2] Discussing the purpose of the lawsuit, Steven said: \"In a public forum, sooner or later the truth comes out. That's what's important to me. I want my last name changed to Johnson, the way it ought to be.\"[2] He maintained that he wanted money from the former first lady in order to provide for two nephews.[2]\n\nShortly after the interview, entertainment writer Harry Haun said that Brown's claims in People \"stirred up such a hornet's nest of book publishers and movie producers that the woman will indeed write a book about\".[9] Haun wrote that literary agent Scott Meredith had been enlisted to handle the book and film rights.[9]",
          "Paternity suit dismissed": "In 1989, Steven Brown's suit against Lady Bird Johnson was dismissed after he failed to show in court.[4][10] He died in 1990, at age 39,[10] from lymphatic cancer.[2]",
          "Later allegations: LBJ and the assassination of JFK": "After the paternity claims, Brown made other allegations suggesting that there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy, including the charge that Johnson had foreknowledge of a plot.[4][11][12] In 1988, she briefly appeared in investigative columnist Jack Anderson's syndicated program, American Expose: Who Murdered JFK, and said: \"In the fall of 1963 I was in the Carousel Club with other advertising people, and Jack Ruby was saying that Lee Harvey Oswald had been in the club and he had been bragging that he had taken a shot at Major General Edwin Walker\".[11] Interviews with Brown implicating Johnson also appeared in an episode of A Current Affair in February 1992, and in a 2003 episode of Nigel Turner's documentary The Men Who Killed Kennedy, titled \"The Guilty Men.\"[11][12]\n\nBrown claimed to have been present at a party in Clint Murchison, Sr.'s Dallas home on the evening prior to the assassination of John F. Kennedy that was attended by Johnson as well as other famous, wealthy, and powerful individuals including, J. Edgar Hoover, Richard Nixon, H. L. Hunt, George Brown, and John McCloy.[4] According to Brown, Johnson had a meeting with several of the men after which he told her: \"After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedys will never embarrass me again. That's no threat. That's a promise.\"[4][13][16]\n\nBrown said that on New Year's Eve 1963, she met with Lyndon Johnson at the Driskill Hotel in Austin, Texas, and that Johnson confirmed the conspiracy to kill Kennedy, insisting that \"Texas oil and ... renegade intelligence bastards in Washington\" had been responsible.[17][18] Brown alleged that Johnson did not attempt to stop the assassination because he hated Kennedy and had an intense desire to be President.[11] Brown also said that she witnessed Oswald meeting with Ruby in the Carousel Club prior to the assassination, but did not specify how long before the assassination this meeting had occurred.[4][5]\n\nIn the years following Brown's allegations, her story has received national attention and several conspiracy authors have cited her claims as evidence of a conspiracy in the case of the JFK assassination.[4]",
          "Allegations challenged": "In November 2012, The Dallas Morning News published an article by Hugh Aynesworth describing David Perry's efforts to disprove Brown's allegations.[4] Perry, a former insurance investigator turned conspiracy debunker, had placed his investigation of her claims on his website in an article entitled \"Texas in the Imagination\" the previous month.[4][19]\n\nAccording to Perry, he and his wife met Brown at a social function a few years after she made her original allegations as to the JFK assassination but did not find her story to be believable.[4] He said he initially decided to investigate Brown's conspiracy claim of Johnson and other notable individuals attending a party at Murchison's house.[4] Perry pointed to evidence placing key figures outside of Dallas on the evening of November 21, 1963, including Johnson (with Kennedy in Houston and in Fort Worth), Murchison (in East Texas), and Hoover (in Washington, D.C.).[4] He said that while Nixon was in Dallas at that time, a writer for The Dallas Morning News had placed him at a bottlers convention in the downtown area.[4]\n\nInvestigating the paternity claims of Brown and her son, Perry found a report of the son's dismissed lawsuit against Lady Bird Johnson in The Dallas Morning News as well as information indicating a prior conviction for Brown on forgery charges.[4] In 1989, Brown was convicted of forging the will of an elderly relative, who had died the previous year, and was sentenced to ten years in prison.[4][20] The conviction was overturned in 1994 when the appeals court determined she had not personally signed the original will.[4][20]\n\nIn 2012, Perry found documents indicating that Steven Mark Brown had previously filed another paternity lawsuit in 1979 claiming to be an heir to the estate of Jerome Ragsdale, the Dallas attorney who Brown said had claimed to be her son's father in order to shield Johnson from negative publicity.[4][21] That suit was dismissed due to lack of evidence.[4][21]\n\n^ Jesse \"J.C.\" Kellum, president and general manager of the Johnsons' radio and television interests,[8] was referred to in newspaper reports about the suit as \"Jess C. Kellam\".[6][7]\n\n^ Jesse \"J.C.\" Kellum, president and general manager of the Johnsons' radio and television interests,[8] was referred to in newspaper reports about the suit as \"Jess C.

          "Lead": "Charles Pearre Cabell (October 11, 1903 – May 25, 1971) was a United States Air Force general and Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (1953–1962).",
          "Early life": "Charles P. Cabell was born in Dallas, Texas on October 11, 1903, the son of Ben E. (son of Confederate general William L. Cabell) and Sadie E. (Pearre) Cabell.[1][2] He attended Oak Cliff High School in Dallas, Texas, and graduated from West Point in 1925.[2][3] He was initially commissioned as an artillery lieutenant and served in the field artillery until 1931, when he went to flying school, and was transferred to the Air Corps.",
          "Military career": "He served in a variety of aviation roles as a staff officer and squadron commander throughout the pre-war years, primarily in observation and pursuit squadrons. He was transferred to the Panama Canal Zone in late 1931 as adjutant of the 7th Observation Squadron, and subsequently commanded 44th Observation, 24th Pursuit, and 74th Pursuit Squadrons in this area. He was promoted to captain sometime during this period.\n\nHe was transferred to Randolph Field, Texas, as flight instructor in 1934 and subsequently served as post adjutant, beginning in 1937. He was detailed to Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama in 1938, graduating in 1939, then detailed to Command and General Staff College at Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1939, graduating in 1940. He was promoted to major sometime during this period. He was assigned to the Photographic unit at Wright Field, Ohio during 1940, and as an observer with the Royal Air Force; in April 1941, he was assigned to the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps as chief of the photographic unit. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel sometime during this period.\n\nIn February 1942, Cabell was assigned as assistant executive for technical planning and coordination in the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, and promoted to colonel. During the summer of 1943, he attended the first course of the Army and Navy Staff College. In late 1943, he was transferred to the Eighth Air Force and assumed command of the 45th Combat Bombardment Wing. In April 1944, he became director of plans for the U.S. Strategic Air Force in Europe, and later that year, having achieved the rank of brigadier general, became director of operations and intelligence for the Mediterranean Air Forces. During the war he served both at air force headquarters at the Pentagon and in the European Theater.\n\nIn May 1945, he was assigned to Air Force headquarters as chief of the Strategy and Policy Division. In December 1945, he was detailed to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, where he held roles as deputy and chief U.S. Air Force delegate to the committee. In August 1947, he was promoted major general and returned to Air Force headquarters, serving in planning and intelligence roles, and became director of Air Force Intelligence in May 1948. In 1949, Cabell set up Project Grudge to \"make a study reviewing the UFO situation for AF HQ.\" However, Grudge quickly became all but moribund, while simultaneously reporting that all UFO cases were being closely investigated. When Cabell learned of this, he ordered Grudge dissolved and ordered that the \"open minded\"[4] Project Blue Book be created.\n\nHe held this director of Air Force Intelligence post until 1951, before being made director of the staff for the Joint Chiefs of Staff from November 1951 to 1953. During this time, he was promoted to lieutenant general.[citation needed] In 1952, he was an enthusiastic promoter of the U-2 spy plane, along with Allen Welsh Dulles and John Foster Dulles.",
          "CIA career": "On April 23, 1953, while still an active air force officer, he was appointed Deputy Director of the CIA under Allen Dulles.[5] In 1956, along with the CIA's Richard Bissell, he flew to Bonn, to brief the West German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, on the ultra-secret U-2 spy plane. Cabell personally negotiated with Chancellor Adenauer for permission to station the U-2 in Wiesbaden and from there to fly over the Soviet Union in violation of air space rights.\n\nCabell was promoted to full general in 1958[6] and retired from active duty effective January 31, 1962.[7]\n\nCabell was forced to resign as deputy director by President Kennedy on January 31, 1962, following the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion.[8] Cabell's brother, Earle Cabell, was Mayor of Dallas when Kennedy visited that city and was assassinated, on November 22, 1963.[9]",
          "JFK assassination": "One hypothesis regarding the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy implicates Cabell and several other CIA officials, including James Jesus Angleton and William King Harvey, as well as the \"three tramps\", and Cabell's brother Earle Cabell.[10]\n\nDuring Jim Garrison's 1973 bribery trial, tape recordings from March 1971 revealed that Garrison considered publicly implicating Cabell of conspiracy in the assassination after learning he was the brother of the Dallas mayor.[11] Theorizing that a plot to kill the President was masterminded out of New Orleans in conjunction with the CIA with cooperation from the Dallas police department and city government, Garrison tasked his chief investigator, Pershing Gervais, of looking into the possibility that Cabell had stayed in the city's Fontainebleau Motel at the time of the assassination.[11] The Washington Post reported that there was no evidence that Gervais ever followed through with the request and that there was no further mention of Cabell in Garrison's investigation.[11]",
          "Personal life": "Cabell was married to Jacklyn DeHymel in 1934; they had two sons, Charles P. Cabell, Jr. and Benjamin Cabell IV, and one daughter, Catharine C. Bennett. He left an autobiography, A Man of Intelligence: Memoirs of War, Peace and the CIA, published in 1997. His oldest son Charles was also an Air Force officer and West Point graduate (Class of 1958), achieving the rank of brigadier general.\n\nHe was a tenth-generation descendant of Pocahontas and a third cousin of Navy four-star admiral Richard H. Jackson.[12]\n\nCabell died at the Fort Myer Clinic in Arlington, Virginia after a heart attack on May 25, 1971.[13]",

          "Lead": "Mary Elizabeth Sutherland Carpenter (September 1, 1920 – March 20, 2010) was a writer, feminist, reporter, media advisor, speechwriter, political humorist, and public relations expert.[1][2][3] As the first woman executive assistant to Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson from 1961 to 1963, and then as press secretary for First Lady Lady Bird Johnson from 1963 to 1969, Carpenter was a prominent member of the Johnson White House and also a close personal friend of the Johnsons.\n\nCarpenter was an ardent supporter of the Women's Movement when it began and never wavered from her convictions. Her projects and causes ranged from supporting the Equal Rights Amendment to fighting cancer. Her lighthearted memoir of her time in the White House, Ruffles and Flourishes, published in 1969, was a national best-seller.[4] Often called the \"funniest woman in politics\", she was in demand as a public speaker until her death.",
          "Early life": "Carpenter was born in her great-grandparents' antebellum home in Salado in southern Bell County, Texas. In 1936, the 24-room Robertson House was declared a state historic monument. In 1967, a plaque was unveiled to indicate that Carpenter had once lived there.[5] Another memorial to Carpenter is on the campus of Salado College, founded by her great-grandfather, Elijah Robertson.[6] At the age of seven, she moved with her family to Austin.[7]",
          "Media and political career": "In 1942, Carpenter began covering the White House and Congress for the Austin American-Statesman. For the next eighteen years, she reported on presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy as a Washington reporter.[8][3]\n\nShe was still a working reporter at the time of the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. She soon joined the staff of Lyndon B. Johnson in his campaign for Vice President in 1960 and traveled on his foreign missions as a press spokeswoman. After Kennedy's election, she became the first woman executive assistant to the vice-president.[citation needed]\n\nCarpenter was in Dallas on November 22, 1963, at the time of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She drafted the fifty-eight words that Johnson used on his return to Washington:[2][3][9]\n\nFollowing Johnson's succession to the presidency, Carpenter became the first professional newswoman to be press secretary to a first lady for Lady Bird Johnson (1963–1969), for whom she also served as staff director.[10] Carpenter also assembled several other staffers as an informal \"White House Humor Group\" to add humorous remarks to the President's speeches, at Johnson's request.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the Johnson Administration ended in 1969, she published Ruffles and Flourishes, her account of her White House experiences.\n\nShe was a vice president of Hill and Knowlton in Washington after leaving the White House. In 1971, she was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and co-chair of ERAmerica, traveling the country to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.[10]\n\nShe was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the International Women's Year Commission, by President Jimmy Carter to serve as Assistant Secretary of Education for Public Affairs, and by President Bill Clinton to serve on the White House Conference on Aging.[11]\n\nCarpenter was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1977 to 1983.[12]",
          "Literary career": "Her books include: Unplanned Parenthood, Random House 1994; Getting Better All the Time, Simon and Schuster 1986, as well as countless articles and forays on the lecture circuit. Start With a Laugh, gives humorous advice on speech writing, was published by Eakin Press and launched at the opening of the National Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future in Dallas. Her most recent book, Presidential Humor, Bright Sky Press 2006, was a compilation of quips and quotes from \"George the First to George the Worst.\"\n\nCarpenter wrote an article for the Reader's Digest in the early 1980s, about enjoying life having recovered from an illness, closing the article with the poem \"Warning\" by British poet Jenny Joseph, which had the opening lines \"When I am an old woman I shall wear purple, With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me\". This led to the poem's fame spreading across the US through adoption by the greetings card industry and eventually the development of the Red Hat Society.[13]",
          "Awards and recognition": "Carpenter was named a Distinguished Alumna of the University of Texas in 1975, and in 1990 was named distinguished alumnae of the Department of Communications. She was named by Governor Mark White to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame.[14] She was given the ProBene Award of the College of Liberal Arts.\n\nThe Liz Carpenter Lectureship was established in 1984 by a group of her friends, including Erma Bombeck and Mark Russell, who gave a performance at the Paramount Theater to raise funds for it. In the last several years, Mrs. Carpenter's lectureship in the College of Liberal Arts has brought President Bill Clinton, President Gerald Ford, Hillary Clinton, Jehan Sadat, Maya Angelou, Bill Moyers, Jane Goodall, and writers such as Betty Friedan, Nora Ephron, Shana Alexander, and Jean Auel and nationally known humorists such as Fannie Flagg and Carol Channing.[15]\n\nThe Liz Carpenter Award is given annually for the best scholarly book on the history of women and Texas published during the calendar year. The Award was established in 1992 by an anonymous donor who is committed to the publication of scholarly research on the history of women and Texas. The award honors Liz Carpenter, a sixth-generation Texan, for her commitment to the pursuit of the history of women in Texas and for a lifetime of achievements that qualify her as a maker of that history.\n\nShe was the recipient of Alpha Phi's Frances E. Willard Award in 1980. She died in Austin, Texas in March 2010.\n\n^ \"Liz Carpenter, journalist, Feminist and Johnson Aide, Dies at 89\". The New York Times. March 21, 2010. p. A22.

          "Lead": "Fred Lee Crisman (July 22, 1919 – December 10, 1975) was a fighter pilot and later educator from Tacoma, Washington known for claims of paranormal events and ties to 20th century conspiracies.\n\nIn 1946, Crisman claimed to have battled with non-humans in caves during the Second World War. The following year, he attempted to convince two early flying saucer witnesses that lava rocks were in fact debris dropped from a flying saucer. In 1968, Crisman was subpoenaed by a New Orleans grand jury in the prosecution of a local man for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy—a prosecution that would later be dramatized in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK.\n\nConspiracy authors consider Crisman \"a nexus point for a number of conspiracies and cover-ups from the late 1940s until [his] death in 1975\".[1]",
          "Early life": "Crisman was born on July 22, 1919, the only child of Fred M. Crisman and wife Eva (born Eva Pitchers, died Eva White, 1971).[2][3] In 1933, he and his family moved to Vale, Oregon; His father ran a hotel there.\n\nIn 1939, Crisman graduated from Vale Union High School.[4] After attending Eastern Oregon College during 1939–40, Crisman left, working as a brakeman for the Union Pacific Railroad.[4]",
          "Military career": "On May 26, 1942, Crisman enlisted in the Army, entering the service with the rank of second lieutenant.[5] In 1943, Crisman was listed an aviation cadet undergoing training at Lancaster, California.[6] He was awarded the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Crisman left the Army as a First Lieutenant on February 19, 1946.[4][5]",
          "Veterans advocate": "In April 1946, Crisman served as representative of the Washington state bureau of veterans' affairs when he called for safety inspections of some used cars.[7] That month, Crisman filed to run for coroner.[8][9] In May, Crisman addressed the Tacoma Real Estate board in the Hotel Winthrop about veterans' real estate problems.[10] In August 1946, Crisman, then described as the head of the state department of veterans' affairs, addressed the Seattle American Veterans chapter.[11] Later that month, he addressed the Lions Club.[12][13] On November 5, Crisman lent his name to an ad endorsing Hugh J. Rosellini for prosecutor.[14] In November 1946, Crisman, then described as a special investigator for the bureau, gave a speech about mental illness in returning servicemen to the Kiwanis club at the Hotel Winthrop.[15] In December 1946, Crisman was elected to represent Washington members of veterans organization AMVETS at an upcoming session.[16]",
          "Relationship with Ray Palmer and Amazing Stories": "In 1946–47, pulp magazine Amazing Stories was an outlet for fantasy, science-fiction, and fringe claims. The May 1946 issue, for example, included purportedly-true fringe adventures by Richard Sharpe Shaver, the fiction of Dorothy & John de Courcy written in the style of Shaver, a defense of the religions of Tibet by Millen Cooke, the fiction of Robert Moore Williams, an allegedly-true eyewitness account of unidentified objects in the skies by Dirk Wylie, and other genre-blurring texts.[17][18]",
          "Promotion of the Shaver mystery": "In June 1946, Amazing Stories published a pseudonymous letter by Crisman in which he claimed to have battled \"mysterious and evil\" underground creatures to free himself from a cave in what is now northern Pakistan during World War II.[1] Wrote Crisman:\n\nI flew my last combat mission on May 26 [1945] when I was shot up over Bassein and ditched my ship in Ramaree Roads off Chedubs Island. I was missing five days. I requested leave at Kashmere. I and Capt. (deleted by request) left Srinagar and went to Rudok then through the Khesa pass to the northern foothills of the Kabakoram. We found what we were looking for. We knew what we were searching for.\n\nFor heaven's sake, drop the whole thing! You are playing with dynamite. My companion and I fought our way out of a cave with submachine guns. I have two 9\" scars on my left arm that came from wounds given me in the cave when I was 50 feet from a moving object of any kind and in perfect silence. The muscles were nearly ripped out. How? I don't know. My friend has a hole the size of a dime in his right bicep. It was seared inside. How we don't know. But we both believe we know more about the Shaver Mystery than any other pair. You can imagine my fright when I picked up my first copy of Amazing Stories and see you splashing words about the subject.\n\nDo not print our names, we are not cowards, but we are not crazy.[4]\n\nThe letter was quoted in the September 1946 issue of Harper's Magazine as an example of a crackpot letter. In May 1947, Amazing Stories published a second Crisman letter, this time identifying him by name. In this letter, Crisman claimed to have traveled to Alaska with his friend Dick, who was killed there.[19][4]",
          "Role in Maury Island incident": "In 1947, Crisman was involved with Harold Dahl in the Maury Island incident, an early UFO incident widely considered to be a hoax, even within Ufology.[20][21] Dahl believed the 1960s TV series, The Invaders was based on Crisman's life.[1]\n\nIn the January 1950 issue of Fate Magazine, Crisman insisted the incident was not a hoax. Wrote Crisman: \"Why, if we were such blackguards and deliberately caused the deaths of two Air Force Pilots and the loss of a $150,000 airplane did not the government or some agency there attempt to seek justice through the courts of the state and federal government\".[4]\n\nOn July 22, 1967, Crisman spoke at a UFO convention in Seattle about the Maury Island incident.[4]",
          "University student": "In Fall 1947, Crisman participated in college community theater in La Grande.[22] In April 1949, Crisman was listed as acting public relations officer of Oregon's first chapter of AMVETS.[23] In summer 1949, Crisman gave talk on \"The Far East\" to a Kiwanis Club.[24] In February 1950, a letter by Crisman was entered into the congressional record. Wrote Crisman: \"China has fallen to the Reds [...] Indo-china is on the verge and will go soon.\" Crisman continued \"It makes me mad to see it all go, while people I thought were in the 'know' grovel and back up before a gang of international brigands whose only difference from the Nazis is the cut of their uniforms. I no longer think the people guiding our state department know just what they are doing...\".[25]\n\nIn September 1950, Crisman was a Willamette University student.[26] In October 1950, he wrote a letter to the editor complaining about the inability of local barbers to give a military trim.[27] In 1951, while studying at Willamette University, Crisman received a teaching assignment at Salem High.[28] On June 10 1951, Crisman was awarded a Bachelor's of Arts.[29][better source needed]",
          "Return to the military": "Amid the Korean War, in April 1951, it was reported that Crisman had been ordered to active duty.[30] That conflict ended in July 1953.",
          "Teaching career": "In 1953, he returned to teaching in Elgin, Oregon.[4] He worked as a teacher and administrator in high schools in Washington and Oregon.[4]\n\nIn December 1953, Crisman served as director of the high school drama club.[31] In 1955, Crisman accepted a job as superintendent at Huntington.[32] On April 15, 1957, Crisman was charged with drunken disorderly, resisting arrest, and pulling a firearm on the arresting officer; He was fined $100.\n\nIn 1958, Crisman was cited in connection with a local tradition of a fictional high school student at White River High.[33] Also in 1958, Crisman took a course at Pacific Lutheran University.[34] In 1959, Crisman organized a fundraising project that sold booklets about the varsity basketball team.[35] In 1960, Crisman's civics class authored a letter to the editor on the Caryl Chessman death penalty case, arguing \"Has the time come when the United States takes orders from other countries? The Chessman case is a problem which is testing the judicial stability of the United States. The exterior infiltration on the United States and the exterior infiltration of the State of California should not force our government to bow down to the opinions of other nations and countries.\"[36] Crisman resigned from White River High in June 1960.[34]\n\nBy 1962, Crisman was attached to Rainer High School.[37] In 1964, Crisman began teaching in the Turner school district, and it was reported his book on \"Industrial Recruiting\" had been accepted for publication.[38] In April 1965, his post was listed as journalism teacher.[39] On February 21, 1966, Crisman was suspended and later dismissed from his teaching position at Cascade High on a charge of insubordination and \"creating a secret society\".[40] The board added that \"the organization is of such a nature that should not be condoned or authorized to exist in this district.\"[41] District officials said the society had been limited to five students, and officials declined to disclose the nature of the organization.[42]",
          "Business and politics": "In 1966, an FBI informant claimed that Crisman had transported $100,000 in cash to California, was doing business as a psychologist, and was suspected of operating a diploma mill.[43] In July 1966, Fate Magazine ran an ad for the \"Western Division of the Parapsychological Society\" inviting new members to join by contacting \"F. Lee Crisman, PhD\".[44][45] In November 1966, Crisman founded The Professional Research Bureau, with T. Edward Beckham and Searoba Bates, seeking \"to conduct research and consultation within the fields of peology research and industrial psychology, public relations and criminology\".[46]",
          "Role in the Clay Shaw trial": "On March 1, 1967, New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw was arrested for conspiring to assassinate John Kennedy. According to controversial district attorney Jim Garrison, the first person Shaw called after being charged was Fred Crisman.[47][48] On October 31, 1968, a grand jury in New Orleans issued a subpoena for Fred Lee Crisman in connection with the investigation into the John F. Kennedy assassination. District attorney Jim Garrison issued a press release, writing:\n\nMr. Crisman has been engaged in undercover activity for a part of the industrial warfare complex for years. His cover is that of a \"preacher\" and a person \"engaged in work to help gypsies.\"\n\nOur information indicates that since the early 1960s he has made many trips to the New Orleans and Dallas areas in connection with his undercover work for that part of the warfare industry engaged in the manufacture of what is termed, in military language, a \"hardware\"—meaning those weapons sold to the U.S. government which are uniquely large and expensive.\n\nMr. Crisman is a \"former\" employee of the Boeing Aircraft Company in the sense that one defendant in the case is a \"former\" employee of Lockheed Aircraft Company in Los Angeles. In intelligence terminology this ordinarily means that the connection still exists but that the \"former employee\" has moved into an underground operation. More often than not a \"bad record\" or evidence indicating that he has been \"fired\" is prepared for the parent company to increase the disassociation between the two.[49][50]\n\nThat same day, Crisman was arrested by Tacoma police for reckless driving.[51]\n\nOn November 21, 1968, Crisman was deposed in the case against Clay Shaw.[1][52] By January 9, 1969, Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorist Richard E. Sprague was privately accusing Crisman of being one of the three tramps.[53]",
          "Broadcasting and politics": "Starting on August 1, 1968, Crisman hosted a radio talk show under the pseudonym \"Jon Gold\" on station KAYE.[54] Crismann authored a pamphlet, under his radio name Jon Gold, titled \"What to do until Sanity Returns\" which he advertised on his show. The work denounced sensitivity training as \"Communist-oriented\" brainwashing. Crisman's pamphlet called for widespread infiltration and disruption of civic organizations like Parent-Teacher Associations.[51] Wrote Crisman:\n\nIn January 1969, Crisman was sued for libel along with other KAYE personalities by a city official who had been accused of being a communist;[55] The case was dismissed.[56]\n\nCrisman authored a book, The Murder of a City, Tacoma published in 1970 through Transistor Publishing Company. The book was described by reviewer Michael Sullivan as a \"weird, politically slanted rant\" that manages to \"tie corruption in Tacoma to everything from communist infiltrators to the Kennedy assassination\".[57]\n\nIn November 1970, KAYE was the subject of hearings by the FCC amid complaints that the station violated the Fairness Doctrine. Crisman's behavior was the subject of extensive discussion, with one witness arguing his playing of \"Nazi war songs\" had jeopardized the station's licence.[58][59] Citizens opposed to KAYE discussed the stations promotion of the antisemitic conspiracy theories and presented transcripts of Crisman making anti-black comments.[60] One listener reported that \"she heard a KAYE broadcast of the Jon Gold Show in which reference was made by a caller to getting rid of Rowlands in the manner which President John Kennedy and his brother were disposed of\".[61] Crisman resigned from KAYE.[62] Two subpoenas were issued for Crisman to appear before the hearings, but he disappeared and could not be located.[63]\n\nIn 1970, Crisman was appointed to the Library Board, despite objections about his false claims of having held a doctorate.[64] Crisman was elected Vice-President of the Tacoma library board.[65] Crisman was named as a possible investor in Tacoma cable television.[66] Local news discussed whether a gun had been allowed inside KAYE.[67]",
          "Final years": "Beginning in 1970, a photocopied document called the \"Torbitt Document\" or \"Nomenclature of an Assassination\" circulated among Kennedy assassination buffs claimed that Crisman was one of the \"three tramps\" allegedly employed by a secret government agency.[68] The document incorrectly names him \"Chrismon\" and falsely claims he was a Syrian immigrant.[69]\n\nIn 1971, Crisman ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the civil service board.[70][71] In 1973, Crisman resigned from the Tacoma Library Board of Directors.[72] Crisman unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Tacoma city council. In September 1974, Crisman was hospitalized for kidney failure. On April 12, 1975, Crisman married Mary Frances Borden.[73]\n\nIn April 1975, True Magazine published a photo of Crisman, speculating he was one of the \"three hobos\" of JFK conspiracy lore.[74] The November 1975 issue of Crawdaddy Magazine repeated this claim and further claimed, without evidence, that \"Olympia police suspected [Crisman] of narcotics activity in connection with a group called \"Servants of Awareness\".[75]\n\nFred Crisman died on December 10, 1975.[54][76] At his death, it was noted that Crisman was a graduate of Willamette University with degrees in political science, history, and education and psychology.[4]",
          "Legacy": "From 1976 to 1985, conspiracy author Richard E. Sprague's fringe book The Taking of America 1-2-3 named Crisman as a grassy knoll shooter.[77]\n\nIn 1977, controversial district attorney Jim Garrison claimed that Crisman was one of the \"Three Tramps\" arrested by Dallas police as well as being a Bishop of the Universal Life Church. Garrison theorized:\n\n\"I suggest the only reasonable conclusion is that he [Crisman] was (and probably is, if still around), an operative at a deep cover level in a long-range, clandestine, intelligence mission directly (in terms of our national intelligence paranoia) related to maintaining national security... Crisman emerges as an operative at a supervisory level ... acquired by the apparatus to carry out the menial jobs that are needed to push a current mission forward, a middle man—in the final analysis—between the mechanics who eliminate, and the handy men, who otherwise support a termination mission, on one hand, and the distant, far removed, deep submerged command level on the other.\"[78]\n\nIn 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had analyzed and compared the photographs of the \"three tramps\" with those of Crisman, as well as with photographs of Watergate figures E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and two other men.[79] According to the Committee, only Crisman resembled any of the tramps; but the same Committee determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.[79]\n\nA document called The Easy Papers was circulated for decades among conspiracy researchers; The document, bearing the date September 13, 1969, purported to be a service record of Crisman's time as an OSS and later CIA agent.[80]\n\nIn 1997, influential conspiracy author Jim Marrs cited the document as proof that Crisman had been a member of the OSS during World War 2; Marrs was criticized for relying on the untrustworthy document.[81] In 1999, conspiracy author Kenn Thomas's book on the Maury Island incident carried the subtitle The Crisman Conspiracy.[82] Conspiracy figure Michael Riconosciuto claims he knew Fred Crisman since Riconosciuto was a child.[83]",
          "Animated comedy": "Fred Crisman: Cave of the Space Nazis is a 2022 animated comedy film based on the tales of Fred Crisman.[84]\n\nThe film begins with the disclaimer: \"The following events are apparently true, based on the many claims of Fred Lee Crisman. Technically, we can't prove this didn't happen.\"\n\nThe first scene sees Fred Crisman broadcasting from Tacoma radio station KAYE. Crisman tells listeners he was not involved with the Kennedy assassination, saying \"I could never have performed such a stunt...\", before slyly adding \"alone\". Crisman claims he has protected the Earth from aliens, saying to doubters \"If you don't believe that I protected this world from egregious extraterrestrials, then I simply ask you: Where are they? I don't see any aliens here. You're welcome!\"\n\nIn flashback to 1946, the film introduces Raymond Palmer, the editor of Unbelievable Tales Magazine, as Crisman recounts an adventurous story of being shot down over the Bay of Bengal during the Second World War. Making his way to Cheduba Island, Crisman seeks shelter in a cave, where he discovers the dead bodies of soldiers. Venturing further into the cave, Crisman discovered the cave is inhabited by the Deros, evil monsters who believe themselves to be the true superior race of the Earth. When Crisman witnesses the Deros torture a victim, he pulls out a pistol, firing it while screaming \"Die, you Space Nazi Monsters!\".\n\nCrisman is wounded in the firefight, receiving a scar on his shoulder (Palmer notes that medical records indicate scar was present when Crisman first enlisted, but Crisman dismisses this as a Deros forgery). Killing many of the enemy, Crisman escapes and lives to tell the tale.\n\nBrock Baker as Richard Shaver\nPat Cashman as Fred Crisman\nGabriella Castro as Radio Jingle Singer\nAlec Crisman as Radio Announcer\nMeghan Nigrelli as The Computer\nHellbent as Dero Victim\nBryan Shickley as The Deros\nNathaniel Williams as Raymond Palmer\n\nBrock Baker as Richard Shaver\n\nPat Cashman as Fred Crisman\n\nGabriella Castro as Radio Jingle Singer\n\nAlec Crisman as Radio Announcer\n\nMeghan Nigrelli as The Computer\n\nHellbent as Dero Victim\n\nBryan Shickley as The Deros\n\nNathaniel Williams as Raymond Palmer\n\nPromotional material described the film emerging after \"a group of talented folks asked the question 'Why hasn't Fred Crisman had a movie yet?'\"[85]\n\nThe film premiered on August 4, 2022, at Gen Con Film Festival, where it garnered the award for Best Comedy.[86][87] Director Bryan Shickley told reporters: \"I love the utter outrageousness that is Fred Lee Crisman, and no matter how you feel about his claims, you just can't come away from spending time with Crisman without forming strong feelings about him.\"[87]\n\nThe film was an official selection of the Brooklyn SciFi Film Festival.[88]\n\n^\na b c d Gulyas, Aaron John (2015). \"Paranoid and Paranormal Precursors from the 1960s to the 1990s\".

According to CIA files, Crisman too was a member of the OSS during World War II, serving as a liaison officer with the British Royal Air Force. At the end of the war, Crisman, supposedly discharged from the military, entered a special OSS Internal Security School and was quietly transferred to the newly formed CIA, where he operated as an \"extended agent,\" primarily as an internal security specialist in \"dis- ruption\" activities. The files show Crisman was involved in a highly classified subsection of Internal Security known as lSece, Easy Sec- tion, a disruption planning unit whose very existence was denied by the CIA. The CIA documents detailed Crisman's activities over the years — including secret reports to the agency on military officers dur- ing the Korean War and company officials while working for Boeing in Seattle — but contained no mention of the Maury Island affair\n^ Thomas, Kenn (1999).

According to CIA files, Crisman too was a member of the OSS during World War II, serving as a liaison officer with the British Royal Air Force. At the end of the war, Crisman, supposedly discharged from the military, entered a special OSS Internal Security School and was quietly transferred to the newly formed CIA, where he operated as an \"extended agent,\" primarily as an internal security specialist in \"dis- ruption\" activities. The files show Crisman was involved in a highly classified subsection of Internal Security known as lSece, Easy Sec- tion, a disruption planning unit whose very existence was denied by the CIA. The CIA documents detailed Crisman's activities over the years — including secret reports to the agency on military officers dur- ing the Korean War and company officials while working for Boeing in Seattle — but contained no mention of the Maury Island affair\n\n^ Thomas, Kenn (1999).

          "Lead": "Elgin English Crull (July 17, 1908–1976) was the city manager of Dallas, Texas from 1952 to 1966.[1][nb 1] Crull was deposed by Warren Commission assistant counsel Leon D. Hubert, Jr. on July 14, 1964 in Dallas.[2]",
          "Early life and education": "Crull was a native of Louisville, Kentucky.[2] He briefly attended Ohio's Western Reserve Academy and Indiana's Culver Military Academy. For higher education, Crull first matriculated at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana for the 1926-27 academic year. Already before enrolling at Purdue, Crull had shown an interest in becoming a newspaper reporter and was familiar with the work that Walter Williams had done to promote journalism, including the founding of the Missouri School of Journalism. That interest prompted Crull to transfer to the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri in 1927 to enroll in the school that Williams had built. There he worked on the student newspaper and was an active member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.[3][4]",
          "Career": "After the University of Missouri, Crull came to Dallas, Texas in 1931 to become a reporter for the Dallas Journal. He quickly rose to become a senior reporter and was in that capacity when the Dallas Journal merged with the Dallas Dispatch in 1938. Because he covered the city beat, Crull came to the attention of James W. Aston, Dallas's city manager at the time who hired him to become his assistant. From 1942 to 1946, Crull served as a U.S. Air Force officer with the rank of major and spent more than half of his time in the service with the management control staff of the Pentagon. He returned to Dallas to assume his old job. This time serving under Roderic B. Thomas. When Charles C. Ford became the city manager in 1951, Crull became the assistant city manager and thereafter city manager when Ford resigned. In 1966, he resigned to become both a vice-president of the Howard Corporation and the Republic National Bank (First Republic Bank Corporation), retiring from both positions in late 1974.[citation needed] Crull died in Dallas's Parkland Hospital in 1976 after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, Katherine Virginia Galbraith.",
          "City manager": "Curry was an assistant city manager or city manager in Dallas for over 25 years.[2] For fourteen years (1952–1966), Crull was Dallas' city manager, holding the position during the administration of four mayors: J.B. Adoue, Jr., R.L. Thornton, Earle Cabell, and Erik Jonsson. \"This was a time when Dallas experienced its greatest growth under Crull's tight efficient government. He is credited with creating a series of capital improvement programs which resulted in extensive public works projects: The present city hall, Dallas Memorial Auditorium, Love Field Terminal and much of the city's major thoroughfares were among the projects completed while he was in office\".[citation needed]\n\nJesse Curry, who became Chief of the Dallas Police Department in January 1960, was appointed to the position by Crull.[2][5]",
          "Professional associations": "Crull was president of the Texas City Managers Association in 1957.[6] He had been a member and past vice-president of the International City Managers Association, as well as a member of the Municipal Finance Officers Association and a Rotarian.\n\n^ In his Warren Commission testimony, Crull described his duties and responsibilities as city manager: \"The city manager, under the Dallas Charter, is the chief administrator of the city government, being charged with the overall supervision of most of the departments of the government. There are a few exceptions. Being charged with the financial control and the operation of the budget, and the operation of the different departments. The city manager is charged with the responsibility of appointing and removing department heads, and assistant department heads, the balance of the organization being under civil service.\"\n\n^ In his Warren Commission testimony, Crull described his duties and responsibilities as city manager: \"The city manager, under the Dallas Charter, is the chief administrator of the city government, being charged with the overall supervision of most of the departments of the government.

          "Lead": "Jesse Edward Curry (October 3, 1913 – June 22, 1980) was an American police officer who was the chief of the Dallas Police Department from 1960 to 1966, which included the period of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in downtown Dallas on November 22, 1963.",
          "Early life": "Born in Hamilton, Texas,[1] Curry and his family moved to Dallas when he was a few months old.[1][2] Curry's father served as a police officer in Dallas for a brief period of time before becoming a Baptist minister.[2] Curry attended Dallas Technical High School.[3] He was an all-district tackle and led his high school football team to the state finals against Greenville High School in 1933.[2] He studied optometry for a short time after graduation.[3] During World War II, Curry served for eleven months in the Civilian Pilot Training Program.[3]",
          "Law enforcement career": "Curry joined the Dallas Police Department as a traffic officer on May 1, 1936, and worked his way up the ranks to become the chief of police on January 20, 1960. As Curry explained it to the Warren Commission, he worked his way up in \"practically every assignment the police department has\", and graduated from the Northwestern University Traffic Institute in 1945/6 and the FBI National Academy in 1951.[3]",
          "Kennedy assassination": "Dallas Chief of Police Jesse Curry was riding in the lead car of the Presidential motorcade with sheriff James Eric \"Bill\" Decker when they turned west off Houston Street onto Elm Street. Looking straight ahead, they noticed \"a few unauthorized people on the overpass and wondered how they got there.\" Those people were later described as thirteen railroad men and two policemen who were stationed on the overpass (Triple Underpass) against rules of protocol. After the Presidential motorcade had proceeded a few more yards, Curry heard the first gunshot and immediately shouted over the police radio: \"Get a man on top of that triple underpass and see what happened up there!\"[4] His words sounded an alarm that something was dreadfully wrong.\n\nOn April 15, 1964, Warren Commission assistant counsel Leon D. Hubert obtained a deposition from Curry at the US Post Office Building in Dallas.[5] The following week on April 22, Curry, along with other officers of the Dallas Police Department, provided testimony to the Commission in Washington, D.C.[6]\n\nCurry later recounted in his Warren Commission testimony and with the LBJ Presidential Library that as he rode in the lead car of the motorcade carrying President Kennedy, he provided security for both the president and the vice-president, Lyndon B. Johnson, at Parkland Memorial Hospital where President Kennedy died, and, later, aboard Air Force One when Johnson was sworn in as the new president.\n\nTwo hours after President Kennedy was assassinated, Dallas Police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald in connection with the fatal shooting of Dallas Police officer J.D. Tippit. Oswald quickly became the prime suspect in Kennedy's death and was charged with both crimes. Curry and the Dallas Police were initially praised for apprehending the assassin so quickly, but the praise ended two days later when Oswald was shot by nightclub owner Jack Ruby while he was being transferred from the basement of the Dallas Police station to the county jail. Curry had allowed journalists and camera men into the area to witness the transfer in an effort to quell rumors that Oswald was being mistreated while in police custody.[7] Curry was later criticized and sometimes blamed for compromising Oswald's safety and allowing him to be killed \"in the basement of his [Curry's] own building.\"[8]\n\nAfter President Kennedy's assassination, Curry and his family received death and kidnapping threats.[8]",
          "Personal life": "Curry was a member of the St. John's United Methodist Church in Dallas, where he was also a choir member.[1][7] Two weeks before his death, he was honored as being the oldest member of the congregation. Curry was also a Freemason.[7]",
          "Marriages and children": "Curry was married twice. He and his first wife had a son, Gene (born 1937). They later divorced. Curry then married Bessie \"Bea\" Wilhelm with whom he had a daughter, Cathey. They remained married until Curry's death in 1980.[2]",
          "Later years and death": "Due to health issues and on the advice of his doctor, Curry retired from the Dallas Police Department in 1966. In 1969, he wrote a book on the subject of JFK's assassination entitled, Retired Dallas Police Chief, Jesse Curry Reveals His Personal JFK Assassination File.[2][9] On November 5, 1969, Curry held a press conference to announce the release of his book said to contain his \"personal file\" of the assassination. During the interview, Curry expressed his doubts about the Warren Commission's single bullet theory and their finding of a lone assassin. Curry stated: \"I'm not sure about it. No one has ever been able to put him (Oswald) in the Texas School Book Depository with a rifle in his hand.\"[10] Curry reasoned in another interview: \"I think there's a possibility that one [shot] could have come from in front [of the limousine]. We've never, we've never been able to prove that, but just in my mind and by the direction of his blood and brain from the president from one of the shots, it would just seem that it would have to [have] been fired from the front rather than behind. I can't say that I could swear that I believe that it was one man and one man alone. I think there's a possibility there could have been another man.\"[11]\n\nAfter his retirement, he worked as director of security at the Texas Bank Building until 1976 when he was forced to step down after suffering two heart attacks. For the remainder of his life, Curry worked as a private investigator.[7]\n\nCurry suffered from diabetes and survived a stroke in 1978.[1] On June 22, 1980, Curry suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep at his Dallas home. He was taken to Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas where he was pronounced dead, at age 66. His funeral was held at the Ed C. Smith Funeral Chapel on June 25, after which he was buried at Grove Hill Cemetery in Dallas.[7]\n\n^\na b c d Brown, Travis (June 23, 1980). \"Jesse E.

          "Lead": "Auxiliary Bishop of Boston (1939–1944)\n\nAuxiliary Bishop of Boston (1939–1944)\n\nRichard James Cushing (August 24, 1895 – November 2, 1970) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Boston from 1944 to 1970 and was made a cardinal in 1958. Cushing's main role was as fundraiser and builder of new churches, schools, and institutions. Unlike his predecessor, he was on good terms with practically the entire Boston elite, as he softened the traditional confrontation between the Catholic Irish and the Protestant upper-class. He built useful relationships with Jews, Protestants, and institutions outside the usual Catholic community. He helped presidential candidate John F. Kennedy deflect fears of papal interference in American government if a Catholic became president.\n\nCushing's high energy level allowed him to meet with many people all day, often giving lengthy speeches at night. He was not efficient at business affairs, and when expenses built up he counted on his fundraising skills instead of cost-cutting. Cushing, says Nasaw, was \"fun-loving, informal, and outgoing. He looked rather like a tough, handsome, Irish cop and behaved more like a ward politician than a high church cleric.\"[1] His major weakness in retrospect was overexpansion, adding new institutions that could not be sustained in the long run and had to be cut back by his successors.[2]",
          "Early life and education": "Cushing was born in City Point, South Boston on August 24, 1895.[3] The third of five children, he was the son of Patrick and Mary (née Dahill) Cushing.[4] His parents were both Irish immigrants; his father was originally from Glanworth, County Cork, and his mother from Touraneena, County Waterford.[5] His father, who came to the United States in 1880,[6] worked as a blacksmith and earned $18 per week in the trolley repair pits of the Boston Elevated Railway.[7]\n\nCushing received his early education at Perry Public Grammar School in South Boston, since there was then no parochial school for boys in Gate of Heaven Parish.[8] Cushing dropped out of high school in his freshman year because of his compulsive truancy.[7] He subsequently entered Boston College High School, a Jesuit college preparatory school.[4] His tuition there was paid by his cousin, who was a priest of the Archdiocese of New York. He graduated from high school in 1913, receiving honors for Latin and Greek. Cushing was torn for a time between religion and politics.[7] He originally wanted to be a politician, even earning money by speaking for politicians from the back of wagons.[6] He twice considered joining the Jesuits,[6] but came to the conclusion he \"was cut out more for the active life and not the teaching apostolate.\"[citation needed]\n\nHe entered Boston College in 1913, becoming a member of the first freshman class following the college's move to Chestnut Hill.[3] At Boston College, he was active in the Marquette Debating Society and elected vice-president of his sophomore class. Following the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915, Cushing enlisted in the United States Army but was medically discharged for his asthma after a few weeks. After attending Boston College for two years, he began his studies for the priesthood at St. John's Seminary in Brighton in September 1915.[4] He was assigned to continue his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, but the escalation of U-boat activity prevented him from sailing across the Atlantic.[citation needed]",
          "Priesthood": "On May 26, 1921, Cushing was ordained a priest by Cardinal William Henry O'Connell at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.[9] His first assignment was as a curate at St. Patrick's Church in Roxbury, where he remained for two months. He was afterwards transferred to St. Benedict's Church in Somerville. In 1922, he appeared unannounced at the residence of Cardinal O'Connell to request an assignment as a missionary.[4] The young priest declared he wanted to \"take heaven by storm.\"[6] O'Connell denied his request, and instead appointed him assistant director of the Boston office of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, an organization dedicated to raising funds for missions.[3] He later served as director of the Society from 1929 to 1944.[3] He was raised to the rank of Monsignor on May 14, 1939.[3]",
          "Episcopal career": "On June 10, 1939, after Bishop Francis Spellman was named Archbishop of New York, Cushing was appointed, at the request of Cardinal O'Connell, as Auxiliary Bishop of Boston and titular bishop of Mela by Pope Pius XII.[9] He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 29 from Cardinal O'Connell, at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, with bishops John Bertram Peterson and Thomas Addis Emmet, SJ, serving as co-consecrators.[9] Cushing took as his episcopal motto: Ut Cognoscant Te (Latin: \"That they may know thee\").[citation needed]\n\nAs an auxiliary bishop, Cushing continued to serve as director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, and was also named pastor of Sacred Heart Church[10] in Newton Centre. Following the death of Cardinal O'Connell in April 1944, he served as apostolic administrator of the archdiocese.[3]",
          "Archbishop of Boston": "Cushing was named the third Archbishop of Boston on September 25, 1944, following the death of Cardinal O'Connell and honoring his earlier request that Cushing succeed him.\n\nDuring his time as archbishop, he oversaw the construction of more than 80 new chapels and churches in the archdiocese.[11] He had a focus on allowing Catholics to live their faith in their daily lives, and this included opening the St. Francis Chapel at the Prudential Center for office workers in the Back Bay, Our Lady of the Railways at South Station, Our Lady of Good Voyage in the Seaport, and Our Lady of the Airways at Logan International Airport.\n\nCushing, a member of the Third Order of St. Francis and the national protector of the Third Order in America, made a side trip to see Assisi, the birthplace of Saint Francis, while leading the National Pilgrimage to Lourdes and Rome.[12] Prior to embarking on the trip, he joked that the closest he had ever been to Rome was South Boston's Castle Island.[13] During this trip, he was awarded the Legion of Honour that day by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman.[14][15]\n\nHis Good Friday sermon in 1961 was given at The Pentagon and was titled \"Power - Divine and Human.\"[16] Speaking in the midst of the Cold War, he preached about of how just as God has great power but often shows restraint, so too should nations, particularly when their military might is concerned.[16]\n\nDuring Cushing's tenure, Boston would see the excommunication of Fr. Leonard Feeney for repeated refusals to be summoned to Rome. Feeney refused to back down from his position, although it has been reported that he was ultimately reconciled with the Church before his death.[17] Cushing approved the moving of at least two priests into new parishes during the 1960s despite allegations of sexual misconduct.[18]",
          "Cardinal": "Cushing was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Susanna by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of December 15, 1958. He was one of the cardinal electors in the 1963 papal conclave, which elected Pope Paul VI.",
          "Kennedys": "A close friend of the Kennedy family, he officiated at the marriage of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Lee Bouvier in 1953, at which he also read a special prayer from Pope Pius XII, and baptized many of the Kennedy children. Cushing gave the prayer invocation at Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.\n\nThe Cardinal also celebrated President Kennedy's funeral Mass in 1963 at St. Matthew's Cathedral, Washington, D.C., following Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, Texas. The day before the funeral, he gave a televised eulogy for the President. Cushing later defended Jacqueline Kennedy after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis in 1968. He received a large amount of hate mail and was contradicted by the Vatican.[19]",
          "Biography of Pope Pius XII": "In 1959, Cushing published his only book, a biography of the late Pope Pius XII (1939–58). It is an almost hagiographic biography, written shortly after the death of the Pontiff.[20] Cushing depicted him as the \"Pope of Peace\" who, armed only with the spiritual weapons of his office, triumphed over insidious attacks that seemed about to destroy the center of Christendom.[citation needed]",
          "Interfaith relations": "His work contributed to making the Roman Catholic Church acceptable to the general population at the time of then-Senator John F. Kennedy's run for the White House. Part of this work included reaching out to the non-Catholics of Boston after \"the muscular style of involved Catholicism that Cardinal O'Connell brought to bear on issues of his day - religious, social, and political - in Boston and Massachusetts\".[21]\n\nAfter the first meeting between Church and Freemasonry which had been held on April 11, 1969, at the convent of the Divine Master in Ariccia, he was the protagonist of a series of public handshakes between high prelates of the Roman Catholic Church and the heads of Freemasonry.[22]\n\nAt the dedication of the St. Francis Chapel at the Prudential Center, Cushing told the crowd of 400 that he wanted it to be an \"ecumenical chapel. We want people of all faiths to come here and speak to God through their own prayers.\"[23]\n\nIn an unprecedented gesture of ecumenism, he encouraged Catholics to attend Billy Graham's crusades.[24] Cushing strongly condemned Communism, particularly the regime of Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia.[25]",
          "Catholic-Jewish relations": "From the very start of Cushing's tenure as Archbishop of Boston, there was a major change in the relationship between official Bostonian Catholicism and Judaism, where there had previously been much mutual suspicion, Cushing sought closer relations.[26] The author James Carroll has attributed Cushing's outlook to the marriage between his sister Dolly Cushing and a local Jewish haberdasherer, Dick Pearlstein. At the time this was very uncommon.[27]\n\nCushing was honored by B'nai B'rith as \"Man of the Year\" in 1956 for \"a lifetime of distinguished service to the cause of human brotherhood under God and in further recognition of great leadership in the fields of education and community relations.\"[28] He was a close correspondent with Robert E. Segal, longtime executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Metropolitan Boston, who played a key role in Jewish-Catholic relations in Boston.[26] Cushing also maintained close contacts with Abram L. Sachar of Brandeis University.",
          "Nostra aetate": "At the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), Cushing played a vital role in drafting Nostra aetate, the document that officially exonerated the Jews of the deicide charge. His emotional comments during debates over the drafts were echoed in the final version:\n\nWe must cast the Declaration on the Jews in a much more positive form, one not so timid, but much more loving ... For the sake of our common heritage we, the children of Abraham according to the spirit, must foster a special reverence and love for the children of Abraham according to the flesh. As children of Adam, they are our kin, as children of Abraham they are Christ's blood relatives. 2. So far as the guilt of Jews in the death of our Savior is concerned, the rejection of the Messiah by His own, is according to Scripture, a mystery—a mystery given us for our instruction, not for our self-exaltation ... We cannot sit in judgement on the onetime leaders of Israel—God alone is their judge. Much less can we burden later generations of Jews with any burden of guilt for the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, for the death of the Savior of the world, except that universal guilt in which we all have a part ... In clear and unmistakable language, we must deny, therefore, that the Jews are guilty of our Savior's death. We must condemn especially those who seek to justify, as Christian deeds, discrimination, hatred and even persecution of Jews ... 3. I ask myself, Venerable Brothers, whether we should not humbly acknowledge before the whole world that, toward their Jewish brethren, Christians have all too often not shown themselves as true Christians, as faithful followers of Christ. How many [Jews] have suffered in our own time? How many died because Christians were indifferent and kept silent? ... If in recent years, not many Christian voices were raised against those injustices, at least let ours now be heard in humility.[29]\n\nHe was deeply committed to implementing the council's reforms and promoting renewal in the Church.[30]",
          "Death": "Due to advanced illnesses, Cushing's resignation as Boston's archbishop was accepted on September 8, 1970. Upon his resignation, Senator Ted Kennedy stated: \"For three-quarters of a century [Cushing's] life has been a light in a world that cries out for illumination. He will never have to account for his stewardship, for if his goodness is not known to God, no one's ever will be.\"[31]\n\nLess than two months after his resignation, on November 2, 1970 (All Souls Day), Cushing died peacefully in his sleep of cancer at the Cardinal's Residence in Brighton, Massachusetts, aged 75. He was surrounded by his brother and sisters and his successor, Archbishop Humberto Medeiros. Cushing was buried in Hanover, Massachusetts at the Portiuncula Chapel on the grounds of the Cardinal Cushing Centers.[32][33][34]",
          "Miscellaneous": "Cushing was a member of the NAACP.[citation needed]\nCushing founded the Missionary Society of St. James the Apostle in 1958 to \"serve the needs of the poorest of the poor in South America\".[35]\nCushing wrote the foreword for the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition of the Bible, and gave his imprimatur to the Oxford Annotated Bible.\n\nCushing was a member of the NAACP.[citation needed]\n\nCushing founded the Missionary Society of St. James the Apostle in 1958 to \"serve the needs of the poorest of the poor in South America\".[35]\n\nCushing wrote the foreword for the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition of the Bible, and gave his imprimatur to the Oxford Annotated Bible.",

          "Lead": "James Henry \"Red\" Duke, Jr. (November 16, 1928 – August 25, 2015) was a trauma surgeon and professor at McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, where he worked on-site since 1972. He was instrumental in introducing Memorial Hermann's Life Flight program and bringing a level I trauma center to Houston.\n\nDuke had a nationally syndicated television spot called Texas Health Reports or Dr. Red Duke's Health Reports, which aired on local television stations in the United States for fifteen years.[1][2]",
          "Early life": "Duke was born in Ennis, Texas.[3][4] He graduated from Hillsboro High School and later earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Texas A&M University in 1950.[4] He served as a yell leader at Texas A&M and was the first person to deliver the poem \"The Last Corps Trip\" publicly.\n\nHe served a two-year tour of duty as a tank officer in the 2nd Armored Division of the U.S. Army and then earned a divinity degree from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1955.[3] After reading a book by Albert Schweitzer, he changed vocations to medicine and enrolled in the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas,[3] from which he received his M.D. in 1960.[4]\n\nDuke completed his internship in internal medicine and his residency in general surgery at Dallas' Parkland Memorial Hospital in 1965. During his residency, Duke was the first surgeon to receive President John F. Kennedy at Parkland after he was shot in Dallas in 1963, then attended to the wounds of then Texas Governor John Connally.[5][6][7][3]\n\nHe also pursued graduate studies at the Columbia University under a National Institutes of Health fellowship.[4]",
          "Career": "Duke was a fourth-year surgery resident at Parkland Hospital the day President John F. Kennedy and Texas Governor Connally were shot and rushed to that hospital. Upon their arrival, Duke says, \"It didn't take long to appreciate the gravity of the situation.\" When asked what can you do for him, he said, \"I can't do much for a dead man.\"[8][9] He is credited with saving the life of Governor Connally.\n\nDuke's academic career began in 1966 as an assistant professor of surgery at UT Southwestern Medical School and later at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. He also took some time to pursue graduate studies in chemical engineering, biochemistry and computer sciences at Columbia University under the auspices of an NIH Special Fellowship. While Duke was an assistant professor of surgery in New York, he spent two years from 1970 to 1972 in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, as a visiting professor and later chairman of surgery at Nangarhar University School of Medicine.\n\nAfter returning from Afghanistan, Duke joined the faculty of McGovern Medical School (formerly the University of Texas Medical School at Houston), where he was a professor of surgery. Among his many responsibilities, Duke served as special assistant to the president of the UT Health Science Center and held one of the distinguished professorships at McGovern Medical School as the John B. Holmes Professor of Clinical Sciences. He established Houston's Hermann Hospital Life Flight operations in 1976 and helped establish its trauma and emergency services, of which he served as director.[3]\n\nDuke was a founding member of the American Trauma Society and was an Advanced Trauma Life Support instructor for the American College of Surgeons. He was named Surgeon of the Year by the James F. Mitchell Foundation in 1988.[10] Duke's efforts to educate the public in health issues and tireless work as a crusader against trauma brought him into serious consideration for the position of Surgeon General of the United States in 1989.\n\nOn August 25, 2015, it was reported that Duke had died at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston from natural causes.[11] He was 86 years old.",
          "Recognition": "The University of Texas Medical School at Houston Department of Surgery sponsored a scholarship fund in honor of Duke, aimed towards students wishing to research and train in the field of trauma.[10]\n\nDuke was also noted outside the medical community. He attained the rank of Eagle Scout, and the Boy Scouts of America honored him with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.[1][12] As founder and past president of the Texas Bighorn Society, Duke was a major supporter of many wildlife conservation organizations. He served as president of the Boone and Crockett Club, the oldest conservation organization in the United States, and the Foundation for North American Wild Sheep.\n\nDuke was also one of the most recognized television personalities in his field, as determined by the Gallup Organization. He was the former host of the nationally syndicated Texas Health Reports[3] and hosted the former PBS series Bodywatch. The programs educated millions about various health-related topics. He was well-recognized for his distinctive Texan accent, ever-present large mustache and \"Duke-isms\" (like his popular segment sign-off \"For your health!\"). Duke has been featured on such programs as PM Magazine, NBC Nightly News, The Today Show and the Buck James television series, which was based on him.[3]\n\nDr. Red Duke Elementary School in the Alvin Independent School District opened in 2014 was named after Duke.[13]\n\nThe Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame inducted Duke in 2010.[14]\n\nThe Memorial Hermann Air Ambulance program, Life Flight, uses the FAA approved callsign “Red Duke” for all IFR flights in support of their air medical transports.\n\n^\na b \"JAMES HENRY \"RED\" DUKE, JR., M.D.\" University of Texas Medical School at Houston.

He attended a Jewish high school, and following this Vytautas Magnus University where he studied law. He then practiced law for five years in Kaunas.[1]\n\nIn 1939 he came to Miami via Cuba. He spoke English, Russian, Lithuanian, Hebrew, Yiddish and German; serving in the US Air Force as a translator during World War 2.[2] Before his retirement he attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.[3]\n\nIn 1955 he accompanied Senator Richard Russell Jr. on a trip to the USSR. Here he and Russell reported seeing \"flying saucers\" which have been said to have been experimental Soviet aircraft.[4]\n\nEfron was charged with the interception and reading of Lee Harvey Oswald's mail before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was also present when in February 1964 the Warren Commission, charged with investigating the assassination, interviewed Oswald's widow Marina.[2]\n\nBesides his work for intelligence, Efron published five articles in the Jewish Bible Quarterly, including a four-part series on 'Military Intelligence in the Bible'.[5] Efron was an observant Orthodox Jew.[6]\n\nHe spent some time in Israel before dying on 22 November 1993.[7]\n\n^ Kampeas, Ron (2 August 2023). \"New JFK documents reveal assassin's CIA monitor was Jewish spy Reuben Efron\".

          "Early life": "Estes was born January 10, 1925, to John and Lillian Estes on a farm near Clyde, Texas, one of six children. Estes never attended college but nonetheless demonstrated a natural talent for business from an early age.\n\nAt 13, [Estes] received a lamb as a gift, sold its wool for $5, bought another lamb and went into business. At 15, he sold 100 sheep for $3,000. He borrowed $3,500 more from a bank, bought government surplus grain and sold it for a big profit. By 18, he had $38,000.[1]\n\nHe served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II.[1]",
          "Fraud schemes": "In the late 1950s, Estes was heavily involved in the Texas anhydrous ammonia business. He produced mortgages on nonexistent ammonia tanks by convincing local farmers to purchase them on credit, sight unseen, and leasing them from the farmers for the same amount as the mortgage payment, paying them a convenience fee as well. He used the fraudulent mortgage holdings to obtain loans from banks outside Texas who were unable to easily check on the tanks.\n\nAt the same time, United States Department of Agriculture began controlling the price of cotton, specifying quotas to farmers. The program included an acreage allotment that normally was not transferable from the land it was associated with, but which could be transferred if the original land was taken by eminent domain.\n\nEstes worked out a method to purchase large numbers of cotton allotments by dealing with farmers who had been dispossessed of land through eminent domain. He convinced the farmers to purchase land from him in Texas and transfer their allotments there, with a mortgage agreement delaying the first payment for a year. Then he would lease the land and allotments back from the farmer for $50 per acre. Once the first payment came due, the farmer would intentionally default and the land would revert to Estes; in effect, Estes had purchased the cotton allotments with the lease fees. However, because the original sale and mortgage were a pretext rather than a genuine sale, it was illegal to transfer the cotton allotments this way. Estes, however, a smooth talker revered by many of his fellow members of the Churches of Christ, asserted the allegations as politics.[2]\n\nIn 1962, after information came to light that Estes had paid off four Agriculture officials for grain storage contracts, President John F. Kennedy ordered the Justice Department and FBI to open investigations into Estes' activities and determine if Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman had also been \"compromised\" (Freeman was cleared).[3] Congress conducted hearings on Estes' business dealings, including some that led to Vice President Johnson, a long-time associate of Estes.[4]\n\nIn 1963 Estes was tried and convicted on charges related to the fraudulent ammonia tank mortgages on both federal and state charges and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. His state conviction was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court in Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532 (1965). His appeal hinged upon the alleged impossibility of a fair trial due to the presence of television cameras and broadcast journalists in the courtroom. He prevailed by a 5–4 vote. Estes was paroled in 1971. Eight years later, he was convicted of other fraud charges and served four more years.\n\nOscar Griffin Jr., the journalist who uncovered the storage tank scandal, later received the 1963 Pulitzer Prize for his articles for a weekly newspaper in Pecos, Texas. To improve his 1961 candidacy for Reeves County school board, Estes offered the local newspaper large advertising buys in exchange for not opposing him. The Pecos Independent responded with an editorial that said, \"We will put our advertising columns up for sale, as will any other newspaper, but we WILL NOT sell our editorial support.\" In response, Estes launched the rival Pecos Daily News on August 1, 1961. He spent about $600,000 and the Independent lost $400,000. It was nearly bankrupt when Griffin, its editor, ran (February 12, 1962) the first of four articles describing Estes's fraud but without naming him. Estes was arrested ten days after the last article ran in March. After his arrest, the Daily News went into receivership and the Independent bought it and merged the two newspapers into the Pecos Enterprise.[5] When Griffin died in 2011, Estes remarked, \"It's a good riddance that he left this world.\"[6]\n\nEstes’ schemes were parodied in 1963 by Allan Sherman in the song Shticks of One and a Half a Dozen of the Other,[2][7] on his album, My Son, the Celebrity.",
          "Relationship with Lyndon Johnson": "Eight days before being sworn in as Vice-President of the United States in 1961, Lyndon B. Johnson wrote to Estes, thanking him for the gift of some roses, writing, \"It's wonderful to have friends like you.\"[8]\n\nAfter the 1961 inauguration, Estes received an invitation from Cliff Carter, a Johnson aide. \"Call me in the Vice-President's office as we can serve you.\" The Pecos Daily News pictured Estes chatting with the Vice-President's daughter during inauguration week.[8]\n\nOn March 28, 1962, during the leases scandal, Estes sought the advice of Frank Cain, an attorney for the Pacific Finance Corporation, one of the institutions to which Estes was in debt. Cain told Holland McCombs, a journalist, that Estes made calls to Lyndon Johnson's Washington office while he was being investigated by federal and state agencies, saying he would have Johnson stop the investigation. \"I'll get ahold of Lyndon and get him to call it off,\" Estes said. By \"it.\" he meant the investigation.[9] Estes contributed large amounts to Johnson's various campaigns for office, but some say that Johnson barely knew Estes, and that Estes was merely a name-dropper.[10]",
          "Allegations linking Johnson to the assassination of Kennedy and others": "Estes alleged in the 1980s that he had inside knowledge that Johnson was involved in the assassination of Kennedy.[11][12] In 1984, he provided a voluntary statement to a grand jury in Texas alleging that the homicide of Henry Marshall, a key investigator in the Department of Agriculture case, was perpetrated by Malcolm Wallace, an aide to Johnson, upon orders from the then-Vice President.[1] Estes claimed that Johnson was involved in the fraud schemes and had the official killed to prevent him from exposing Johnson's role.[13] Two former Johnson associates responded to the allegations stating Estes was a \"pathological liar\".[14] When the Department of Justice asked for more information, Estes responded that he would provide information on eight other murders ordered by Johnson, including the assassination of Kennedy, in exchange for immunity from prosecution and a pardon. According to Estes, Johnson set up the assassination to become president.[1]\n\nEstes reiterated the claim in JFK Le Dernier Témoin: Assassinat de Kennedy, Enfin La Vérité! (\"JFK The Last Witness: Kennedy's Assassination, Finally The Truth!\"),[citation needed] a book he co-wrote with a French writer in 2003.[12][15] He said that he was not interested in writing the book—published only in France—but that he was offered \"a few hundred thousand dollars\" to contribute to it.[12] According to the Associated Press, the allegation was \"rejected by prominent historians, Johnson aides and family members.\"[15]",

          "Lead": "David William Ferrie (March 28, 1918 – February 22, 1967) was an American pilot who was alleged by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison to have been involved in a conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy.[1] Garrison also alleged that Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald. Ferrie denied any involvement in a conspiracy and said he never knew Oswald.[2] Decades later, photos emerged establishing that Ferrie had been in the same Civil Air Patrol unit as Oswald in the 1950s, but critics have argued this does not prove that either Ferrie or Oswald was involved in an assassination plot.[3]",
          "Early life": "Ferrie was born in Cleveland, Ohio. A Roman Catholic, Ferrie attended St. Ignatius High School, John Carroll University, St. Mary's Seminary, where he studied for the priesthood, and Baldwin Wallace College. He next spent three years at the St. Charles Seminary in Carthagena, Ohio. He suffered from alopecia areata, a skin condition that results in hair loss and the severity of which may increase with age. Later in life, to compensate for his hair loss, Ferrie wore a homemade auburn wig and false eyebrows.[4]\n\nIn 1944 Ferrie left St. Charles because of \"emotional instability.\"[4] He obtained a pilot's license and began teaching aeronautics at Cleveland's Benedictine High School. He was fired from the school for several infractions, including taking boys to a house of prostitution.[5] He then became an insurance inspector and, in 1951, moved to New Orleans where he worked as a pilot for Eastern Air Lines, until losing his job in August 1961, after being arrested twice on morals charges.[6]\n\nFerrie was involved with the Civil Air Patrol in several ways: He started as a Senior Member (an adult member) with the Fifth Cleveland Squadron at Hopkins Airport in 1947.[7] When he moved to New Orleans, he transferred to the New Orleans Cadet Squadron at Lakefront Airport. There he served as an instructor, and later as the Commander.[7] After a Ferrie-trained cadet pilot perished in a December 1954 crash, Ferrie's annual re-appointment was declined. He was asked to be a guest aerospace education instructor at a smaller squadron at Moisant Airport, and lectured there from June to September 1955. On July 27, 1955, 15-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald joined this squadron.[8]\n\nIn March 1958, a former cadet-turned-commander invited Ferrie back to the New Orleans Cadet Squadron. Ferrie served unofficially for a time and was reinstated as Executive Officer in September 1959. Ferrie quit the squadron in June 1960 after a disagreement during a bivouac. In September 1960, he started his own unofficial squadron, called the Metairie Falcon Cadet Squadron.[9] An offshoot of this group was the Internal Mobile Security Unit, a group formed for the fight against Fidel Castro's Cuba.[10] Over the years, he used both his official and unofficial squadrons to develop improper relations with boys ranging in age from 14 to 18, and his August 1961 arrests caused the Falcons to fold.[10]\n\nFerrie described himself as a liberal on civil rights issues, and he was \"rabidly anti-Communist\", often accusing previous U.S. presidential administrations of being \"sell-outs\" to Communism.[5] Ferrie initially supported Castro's campaign against Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, but by mid-1959 became convinced that Castro was a Communist. According to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, Ferrie \"found an outlet for his political fanaticism in the anti-Castro movement.\" By early 1961, Ferrie was working with right-wing Cuban exile Sergio Arcacha Smith, head of the Central Intelligence Agency-backed Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front in New Orleans. In a newspaper interview in July, 1961, Ferrie explained why he was volunteering for the organization. \"I got interested after our botched-up Cuban invasion of April 17,\" he said, referring to the Bay of Pigs Invasion.[11] Ferrie soon became Arcacha Smith's \"eager partner in counterrevolutionary activities.\" Both were involved in a raid in late 1961 on a munitions depot in Houma, Louisiana, \"in which various weapons, grenades and ammunition were stolen.\"[12][13]\n\nFerrie often spoke to business and civic groups on political issues. In July 1961, Ferrie gave an anti-Kennedy speech before the New Orleans chapter of the Military Order of World Wars, in which \"his topic was the Presidential administration and the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco.\"[5] In his speech, Ferrie attacked Kennedy for refusing to provide air support to the Bay of Pigs invasion force of Cuban exiles.[14] Ferrie's tirade against Kennedy was so poorly received that he was asked to leave the podium.[5] Ferrie admitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after the assassination, that when speaking about Kennedy, he might have used the expression: \"He ought to be shot.\" Ferrie insisted, however, that these words were just \"an off-hand or colloquial expression.\"[14]\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ferrie became involved with Guy Banister, former Special Agent In Charge (SAC) of the Chicago office of the FBI, right-wing political activist, segregationist, and private investigator. Banister also worked with Ferrie's associate, Sergio Arcacha Smith. In early 1962, both Banister and Arcacha Smith maintained offices in the Newman Building at the corner address of 544 Camp Street / 531 Lafayette Street, New Orleans, the same address printed on Lee Harvey Oswald's distributed pro-Castro pamphlets.[15][16][17]\n\nIn February 1962, Banister assisted Ferrie in his dispute with Eastern Airlines regarding \"charges brought [against Ferrie] by the airline and local New Orleans police of crimes against nature and extortion.\"[13] During this period, Ferrie was often seen at Banister's office.[18] Banister testified to Ferrie's \"good character\" at an airline pilot's grievance board hearing in the summer of 1963.[13][18]\n\nAccording to several witnesses, Ferrie and Banister also worked together in the fall of 1963 for lawyer G. Wray Gill, on behalf of Gill's client, New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello, in an attempt to block Marcello's deportation to Guatemala.[13] On a related matter, the House Select Committee on Assassinations stated that \"An unconfirmed Border Patrol report of February 1962 alleges that Ferrie was the pilot who flew Carlos Marcello back into the United States from Guatemala after he had been deported in April 1961 as part of U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's crackdown on organized crime.\"[19] Another report, this one by the FBI, \"indicated Marcello offered [Ferrie associate Sergio] Arcacha Smith a deal whereby Marcello would make a substantial donation to the [anti-Castro] movement in return for concessions in Cuba after Castro's overthrow.\"[19]",
          "Allegations of involvement in the Kennedy assassination": "The FBI and Secret Service were interested in Ferrie as early as November 25, 1963, just three days after the Kennedy assassination. He and two other men were arrested and booked for vagrancy by the New Orleans district attorney's office; they were \"held for investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service\". They were released the next day. First Assistant District Attorney Frank Klein, who questioned Ferrie with investigators, said he could not comment on the case.[20] It was later reported that Ferrie was \"intensely interrogated by the district attorney's office in 1963 after the assassination\" and \"talked also to the FBI and the Secret Service.\"[21]\n\nOn the afternoon of November 22, 1963 – the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated and the day Carlos Marcello was acquitted in his deportation case – New Orleans private investigator Guy Banister and one of his employees, Jack Martin, were drinking together at a local bar. On their return to Banister's office, the two men got into a heated argument. According to Martin, Banister said something to which Martin replied, \"What are you going to do – kill me like you all did Kennedy?\" Banister drew his .357 magnum revolver and pistol-whipped Martin several times. Martin, badly injured, went by ambulance to Charity Hospital.[22]\n\nIn the ensuing days, Martin told reporters and authorities that Ferrie might have been involved in the assassination. Martin told the New Orleans police that Ferrie \"was supposed to have been the getaway pilot in the assassination.\"[1] He said that Ferrie had threatened Kennedy's life, even outlining plans to kill him, and that Ferrie might have taught Oswald how to use a rifle with a telescopic sight. Martin also claimed that Ferrie had known Oswald from their days in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol, and that he had seen a photograph, at Ferrie's home, of Oswald in a Civil Air Patrol group.[23]\n\nMartin also told bail bondsman Hardy Davis that he had heard on television that Ferrie's New Orleans library card had been found in Oswald's possession when he was arrested in Dallas. Davis reported this to Ferrie's employer, the lawyer G. Wray Gill.[24] In fact, no such library card was found among Oswald's possessions.[25] Ferrie subsequently visited both Oswald's former New Orleans landlady and a former neighbor about this report.[26] Ferrie was able to produce his library card for FBI agents who interviewed him on November 27, 1963.[27]\n\nMartin also claimed that Ferrie had driven from New Orleans to Texas on the night of the assassination. Ferrie gave various accounts of his trip to Texas. When questioned by the FBI, Ferrie stated that he and two friends drove 350 miles (560 km) to the Winterland Skating Rink in Houston, about 240 miles (390 km) from Dallas, that evening. Ferrie said that \"he had been considering for some time the feasibility and possibility of opening an ice skating rink in New Orleans\" and wanted to gather information on the ice rink business. \"He stated that he introduced himself to [rink manager] Chuck Rolland and spoke with him at length concerning the cost of installation and operation of the rink.\"[28] Another explanation for the trip appeared in a 1967 newspaper article, in which Ferrie said he and two friends went to Texas \"for relaxation after he had completed a job of investigative work for a local attorney on a federal case.\"[21] In another newspaper, Ferrie describes the trip as a \"spur-of-the-moment\" decision by him and two friends at about 3:20 p.m. Nov. 22, 1963: \"We drove by car to Vinton, La., then to Houston and Galveston, where we hunted geese.\"[29]\n\nOn November 25, Martin was contacted by the FBI. Martin told the FBI that Ferrie might have hypnotized Oswald into assassinating Kennedy. The FBI considered Martin's evidence unreliable. Nevertheless, FBI agents interviewed Ferrie twice about Martin's allegations.[30] Ferrie admitted that he had made public and private statements criticizing Kennedy's actions during the Bay of Pigs, but he denied ever stating that the President should be killed. He stated that he had no recollection of having met Oswald and if he had the meeting would have been \"very casual\".[31] Ferrie stated that Martin had \"bedeviled him in every manner possible\" since sending him out of Gill's office in an \"undiplomatic manner\" in June 1963.[32][33] Gill told the FBI that Martin blamed Ferrie for not getting a job and subsequently \"slandered Ferrie at every opportunity\".[22] The FBI also interviewed about 20 other people in connection with Martin's allegations. The FBI said that it was unable to develop a substantial case against Ferrie. An inquiry by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, conducted a decade and a half later, concluded that the FBI's \"overall investigation of the 544 Camp Street issue at the time of the assassination was not thorough.\"[34]\n\nAfter learning of the allegations, Ferrie contacted several of his former Civil Air Patrol associates for more information about Oswald. Former cadet Roy McCoy told the FBI that \"Ferrie had come by looking for photographs of the cadets to see if Oswald was pictured in any photos of Ferrie's squadron.\"[35] Some of this information reached Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans, who had become increasingly interested in the assassination after a chance meeting with Louisiana Senator Russell Long in late 1966. Garrison said that Long told him: \"Those fellows on the Warren Commission were dead wrong. There's no way in the world that one man could have shot up Jack Kennedy that way.\"[36][37]\n\nIn December 1966, Garrison interviewed Martin. Martin claimed that during the summer of 1963, Ferrie, Banister, Oswald, and a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles were involved in operations against Castro's Cuba that included gun running activities and burglarizing armories.[38] Garrison later wrote: \"The Banister apparatus ... was part of a supply line that ran along the Dallas–New Orleans–Miami corridor. These supplies consisted of arms and explosives for use against Castro's Cuba.\"[38]\n\nAs Garrison continued his investigation, he became convinced that a group of right-wing extremists, including Ferrie, Banister, and Clay Shaw, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the CIA to kill Kennedy. Garrison later claimed that the motive for the assassination was anger over Kennedy's attempts to obtain a peace settlement in both Cuba and Vietnam.[39][40] Garrison also believed that Shaw, Banister, and Ferrie had conspired to set up Oswald as a patsy in the JFK assassination.[41]",
          "Death": "On February 22, 1967, less than a week after the now-defunct afternoon newspaper the New Orleans States-Item broke the story of Garrison's investigation, Ferrie was found dead in his apartment.[42] Two unsigned, undated typed letters were found at Ferrie's apartment. The first, found in a pile of papers, was a screed about the justice system, beginning with \"To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect. I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome.\"[43][44] The second note was written to Al Beauboeuf, Ferrie's friend to whom he bequeathed all his possessions.[43] Garrison said he considered Ferrie's death a suicide, but added \"I am not ruling out murder.\"[42] Garrison's aide, Lou Ivon, stated that Ferrie telephoned him the day after the story of Garrison's investigation broke and told him: \"You know what this news story does to me, don't you. I'm a dead man. From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.\"[45]\n\nFerrie's autopsy was performed by Orleans Parish coroner Nicholas Chetta and pathologist Ronald A. Welsh.[46] They concluded that there was no evidence of suicide or murder and that Ferrie died of a massive cerebral hemorrhage due to a congenital intracranial berry aneurysm that had ruptured at the base of his brain.[42][47][48][49] Upon learning of the coroner's findings, Garrison said, \"I suppose it could just be a weird coincidence that the night Ferrie penned two suicide notes, he died of natural causes.\"[39] On March 1, 1967, Garrison had Shaw arrested and charged him with conspiring to assassinate Kennedy.[50] Jack Wardlaw, then with the States-Item, and his fellow journalist Rosemary James, a native of South Carolina, co-authored Plot or Politics, a 1967 book which takes issue with the Garrison investigation. Wardlaw won an Associated Press award for his story on the death of Ferrie.[51]",
          "Allegations regarding a relationship between Ferrie and Oswald": "In an initial interview with the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, Banister's long-time friend and secretary, Delphine Roberts, stated that she had never seen Oswald; however, in a subsequent interview she stated that she had seen Oswald in Banister's office several times.[52] According to Roberts, the first time she saw Oswald in Banister's office was when he interviewed for a job in the summer of 1963[53] and on another occasion he brought his wife, Marina, with him.[54] Reporter Earl Golz wrote that Roberts said Oswald had interviewed for the position of \"undercover agent\" and that he and Ferrie - who she said was \"detective agent\" for Banister - had together attended an anti-Castro training camp for rifle practice.[55] The HSCA investigated Roberts's claims and said that \"because of contradictions in Roberts' statements to the committee and lack of independent corroboration of many of her statements, the reliability of her statements could not be determined.\"[54]\n\nIn 1979, the HSCA stated in its Final Report that Oswald – who had been living in New Orleans in the summer of 1963 – had established contact with anti-Castro Cubans[56] and \"apparently\" with American anti-Castro activist Ferrie.[57] The Committee also found \"credible and significant\" the testimony of six witnesses who placed Oswald and Ferrie in Clinton, Louisiana, in September 1963.[58] One of the witnesses was Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) chairman Corrie Collins. Collins identified a photograph of Ferrie at the trial of Clay Shaw, saying, \"but the most outstanding thing about him [Ferrie] was his eyebrows and his hair. They didn't seem real, in other words, they were unnatural, didn't seem as if they were real hair.\"[59] A later release of witness statements taken by Garrison's investigators in 1967, unavailable to the HSCA, showed contradictions in the witnesses' testimony given in 1969 and 1978.[60] For example, Collins was shown a photo of Ferrie by Garrison investigator Andrew Sciambra in January 1968 and (in Sciambra's words) \"said that he remembers seeing this man around Clinton somewhere but can't be sure where or when.\"[61] Yet later at the Shaw trial, he placed Ferrie in the company of Shaw and Oswald.[62] In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations stated that available records \"lent substantial credence to the possibility that Oswald and [David] Ferrie had been involved in the same [Civil Air Patrol] unit during the same period of time.\"[8] Committee investigators found six witnesses who said that Oswald had been present at Civil Air Patrol meetings headed by Ferrie.[63]",
          "Frontline photograph": "In 1993, the PBS television program Frontline obtained a group photograph, taken eight years before the assassination, that showed Oswald and Ferrie at a cookout with other Civil Air Patrol cadets.[3] Frontline executive producer Michael Sullivan said, \"one should be cautious in ascribing its meaning. The photograph does give much support to the eyewitnesses who say they saw Ferrie and Oswald together in the CAP, and it makes Ferrie's denials that he ever knew Oswald less credible. But it does not prove that the two men were with each other in 1963, nor that they were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president.\"[3] John Ciravolo, the owner of the photo, told author Patricia Lambert: \"I'm in the picture... I'm sure David Ferrie wouldn't remember me either.\"[64] Author John C. McAdams wrote: \"The photo doesn't prove that they ever met or talked to each other, but only that they were in the organization at the same time.\"[65]",
          "Portrayals": "Ferrie was portrayed by actor Joe Pesci[66] in the Oliver Stone film JFK (1991), by Tobin Bell in the film Ruby (1992),[67] and by Louis Vanaria in the movie The Irishman (2019), also starring Pesci.\n\n^\na b David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 112–113.\n^ FBI Interview with David Ferrie, November 25, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, p. 286.\n^\na b c PBS Frontline \"Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald\", broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).\n^\na b David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 106.\n^\na b c d David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 107.\n^ David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 107–108, 108–110.\n^\na b David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 108.\n^\na b Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol, House Select Committee on Assassinations, Volume 9, 4, p. 110.\n^ David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 108–109.\n^\na b \"David Blackburst Archive: David Ferrie: Civil Air Patrol File\".\n^ \"Cuban Refugees Need Food, Clothes\".

          "Lead": "James Earl Files (born January 24, 1942), also known as James Sutton,[a] is an American former prisoner. In 1994, while serving a 50-year sentence for the 1991 attempted murders of two police officers, Files gave interviews stating that he was the \"grassy knoll shooter\" in the 1963 assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy.[3][4][5] He said he took one shot at Kennedy with a Remington XP-100 \"fireball\" gun, which was the final, fatal, head shot which infamously caused Kennedy's to jerk violently back and to the left.[6][7] Files has subsequently been interviewed by others and discussed in multiple books pertaining to the assassination and related theories.[4][5] In 1994, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was quoted as having investigated Files' allegation and found it \"not credible\".[3][8]\n\nIn 2010, Playboy magazine published an article by Hillel Levin in which Files also implicated Charles Nicoletti and John Roselli in the assassination of Kennedy.[9] In 2022 Ted Nelson posted a video interview with Files on his YouTube channel.[10]",
          "Background": "Files has stated that he was born in Alabama, moved to California with his family shortly thereafter, then to an Italian neighborhood in Chicago.[11] On May 7, 1991, Files and his friend, David Morley, were involved in a roadside shootout in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, with two police officers, Detective David Ostertag and his partner, Gary Bitler. Ostertag and Bitler tried to apprehend the two for driving a stolen vehicle. During the shootout, Morley shot Detective Ostertag in the chest. Both Files and Morley shot at Detective Bitler, but missed. Files and Morley then fled on foot, but were arrested a few hours later. Files was charged with two counts of attempted murder and one count each of discharge of a firearm, aggravated battery with a firearm and armed violence. In August 1991, a jury found Files guilty of two counts of attempted murder. He was sentenced to 30 years for the shooting of Detective Ostertag and 20 years for attempting to shoot Detective Bitler.[2][12][13] Files was initially imprisoned at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, before being transferred to Danville Correctional Center in Danville, Illinois.[2][14] Files was paroled in May 2016.[14]\n\nAn \"anonymous FBI source\", later identified as Zack Shelton, has been reported by some researchers as having told Joe West, a private investigator in Houston, in the early 1990s about an inmate in an Illinois penitentiary who might have information about the Kennedy assassination.[5][15] On August 17, 1992, West interviewed Files at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois.[2] After West's death in 1993, his family requested that his friend, Houston television producer Bob Vernon, take over the records concerning the story.[2][3] Vernon is the owner of a bullet casing with teeth marks on it, even though it was not found until 1987.[12]",
          "Critical analysis": "Vincent Bugliosi, author of Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, characterized Files as \"the Rodney Dangerfield of Kennedy assassins.\"[2] According to Bugliosi, very few within the majority of Americans (75%) who believe there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy respect him or his story.[2] However, psychology professor Jerome Kroth described Files as \"surprisingly credible\" and said his story \"is the most believable and persuasive\" about the assassination.[2]\n\n^ In his testimony before the Assassination Records Review Board, Robert G. Vernon said that the name \"James Sutton\" was an alias.[1] In Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Vincent Bugliosi wrote that \"James Sutton\" was his \"true name\".[2]\n\n^ In his testimony before the Assassination Records Review Board, Robert G.

          "Lead": "John William Fritz (June 15, 1896 – April 19, 1984) was the captain of Homicide and Robbery Bureau of the Dallas Police Department. In November 1963, he received nationwide attention as the head of the police investigation of the murder of president John F. Kennedy and the primary interrogator of Lee Harvey Oswald.[1]",
          "Early life": "Fritz was born on June 15, 1896, in Dublin, Texas. He spent much of his childhood on a ranch near Lake Arthur, New Mexico. As a young man, he earned a living as a horse and mule merchant, traveling around West Texas and New Mexico. He served briefly in the army during World War I. In the early 1920s, he enrolled in Tarleton State College (now Tarleton State University) in Stephenville, Texas.[1]",
          "Police career": "Fritz joined the Dallas Police Department in 1921 and soon became a detective. In the early 1930s, he was involved in the hunt for Bonnie and Clyde.[2] He was promoted to captain in 1934 to organize the Homicide and Robbery Bureau. Although he was made an inspector of detectives in 1935, he voluntarily returned to the rank of captain in 1944. In 1947, he was given the title of senior captain, as he reportedly refused the offer to become the Dallas police chief. As the captain of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau, Fritz gained a reputation as a skilled interrogator.[1]\n\nThe Homicide and Robbery Bureau was considered the elite unit of the Dallas Police Department, and its detectives wore unique Stetson hats.[2] Because of his experience and intimidating demeanor, most Dallas police officers respected and feared Fritz more than Dallas police chief Jesse Curry. According to author Vincent Bugliosi, Fritz was known to run his bureau as his \"own private and independent fiefdom\". Dallas district attorney Henry Wade told the Warren Commission that Fritz \"runs a kind of one-man operation\", and was reluctant to tell others what he was doing.[2]",
          "Kennedy assassination": "On November 22, 1963, around 1 PM (about 30 minutes after the assassination), Fritz led the search of the Texas School Book Depository building. A bolt action rifle and three empty rifle cartridges were discovered by his team on the building's sixth floor.[3]\n\nAfter Oswald's apprehension as a suspect in the killing of officer J. D. Tippit, Fritz connected him to the Kennedy assassination, because Oswald was the only employee missing from the building.[3]\n\nFritz questioned Oswald all afternoon about the shootings of Kennedy and Tippit. The Dallas police intermittently questioned him for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m., on November 24.[4] Throughout, Oswald denied any involvement with either shooting.[4] Fritz kept only rudimentary notes.[5][6] Days later, he wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards.[5] There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally participated in the questioning.[7] Several of the FBI agents who were present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.[8]\n\nOn the evening of November 22, Texas School Book Depository superintendent Roy Truly was overheard by reporter Kent Biffle, informing Fritz that he had seen Oswald in “a storage room on the first floor”. Fritz wrote that Truly saw Oswald “immediately after the shooting somewhere near the back stairway”. The storage room on the first floor was located near the back stairway.[9][10] Fritz wrote in his notes that Oswald claimed he was “out with [William Shelley, a foreman at the depository] in front”.[11][12]\n\nFritz did not get a confession from Oswald, but said he had all the proof he needed to convict. On November 22, before midnight, Fritz formally charged Oswald with murder.[1]\n\nOperating under chief Curry, Fritz helped plan the transfer of Oswald from the police headquarters to the Dallas county jail. He was present when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby on November 24.[1]\n\nFritz provided testimony to Warren Commission assistant counsel Joseph A. Ball.[3] He provided additional testimony on July 14, 1964 to assistant counsel Leon D. Hubert Jr.[13]",
          "Later life and death": "Fritz rarely gave interviews or spoke about the assassination in public. In 1969, he was transferred to the position of night commander of the criminal investigation division, a move that can be interpreted as a demotion. Fritz retired on February 27, 1970 after 49 years of service, and spent his retirement hunting, fishing and keeping cattle. He was divorced from his wife, and lived alone much of his life in the White Plaza Hotel, located near the Dallas police headquarters.[2][1]\n\nFritz died on April 19, 1984.[1]",
          "Portrayals in movies": "Fifteen years after the assassination, Fritz was portrayed by Lou Frizzell in the 1978 made-for-television movie, Ruby and Oswald.[14]\n\nIn the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK, Fritz was portrayed by William Larsen.[15]\n\nHe was portrayed by Mike Shiflett in the 2013 TV movie Killing Kennedy.[16]\n\n^\na b c d e f g \"TSHA | Fritz, John Will\". www.tshaonline.org.

          "Lead": "James Carothers Garrison (born Earling Carothers Garrison; November 20, 1921 – October 21, 1992)[3] was the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, from 1962 to 1973 and later a state appellate court judge. A member of the Democratic Party, he is best known for his investigations into the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the prosecution of New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw to that effect in 1969, which ended in Shaw's acquittal. He wrote three published books, one of which became a prime source for Oliver Stone's film JFK in 1991, in which Garrison was portrayed by Kevin Costner, while Garrison himself made a cameo appearance as Earl Warren.",
          "Early life and career": "Garrison was born in Denison, Iowa, in 1921.[4][5][6] He was the first child and only son of Earling R. Garrison and Jane Anne Robinson who divorced when he was two years old.[3] His family moved to New Orleans quite early into his childhood, where he was raised by his divorced mother. He served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, having joined the year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After the war he obtained a law degree from Tulane University Law School in 1949. He then worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for two years where he was stationed with the Seattle office.[7]\n\nLeading up to the Korean War era, Garrison joined the National Guard, even applying for active duty with the Army in 1951, but because of recurring nightmares of past missions Garrison was then relieved of duty by the Army. Remaining in the Guard, when it became apparent that he suffered from shell shock due to his numerous bombing missions flown during World War II,[8] led one Army doctor to conclude that Garrison had a \"severe and disabling psychoneurosis\" which \"interfered with his social and professional adjustment to a marked degree. He was considered totally incapacitated from the standpoint of military duty and moderately incapacitated in civilian adaptability.\"[9] Yet, when his record was reviewed further by the U.S. Army Surgeon General, he \"found him to be physically qualified for federal recognition in the national army.\"[10] Upon returning again to civilian life, Garrison worked in several different trial lawyer positions before winning election as New Orleans District Attorney, starting with his first of three terms in January 1962.[7]",
          "District attorney": "In the years prior to winning office as New Orleans District Attorney in 1961, Garrison worked for the New Orleans law firm of Deutsch, Kerrigan & Stiles from 1954 to 1958, before he first became an assistant district attorney. Garrison became a flamboyant, colorful, well-known figure in New Orleans, but was initially unsuccessful in his run for public office. He lost a 1959 election for criminal court judge. In 1961, he ran for district attorney and won against incumbent Richard Dowling by 6,000 votes in a five-man Democratic primary. Despite lack of major political backing, he facilitated his victory through excellent performance in a television debate and last-minute television commercials.\n\nOnce in office, Garrison cracked down on prostitution and the abuses of Bourbon Street bars and strip joints. He indicted Dowling and one of his assistants for criminal malfeasance, but the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. Garrison did not appeal. Garrison received national attention for a series of vice raids in the French Quarter, staged sometimes on a nightly basis. Newspaper headlines in 1962 praised Garrison's efforts, \"Quarter Crime Emergency Declared by Police, DA. – Garrison Back, Vows Vice Drive to Continue – 14 Arrested, 12 more nabbed in Vice Raids.\" Garrison's critics often point out that many of the arrests made by his office did not result in convictions, implying that he was in the habit of making arrests without evidence; however, assistant DA William Alford said that charges would, more often than not, be reduced or dropped if a relative of someone charged gained Garrison's ear. Alford said Garrison had \"a heart of gold\".[11]\n\nAfter a conflict with local criminal judges over his budget, Garrison accused them of racketeering and conspiring against him. The eight judges charged him with misdemeanor criminal defamation, and Garrison was convicted in January 1963. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction and struck down the state statute as unconstitutional.[12] At the same time, Garrison indicted Judge Bernard Cocke with criminal malfeasance and, in two trials prosecuted by Garrison himself, Cocke was acquitted. Garrison charged nine policemen with brutality, but dropped the charges two weeks later. At a press conference, he accused the state parole board of accepting bribes, but could obtain no indictments. Critical of the state legislature, Garrison was unanimously censured by it for \"deliberately maligning all of the members\".[13] In 1965, running for reelection against Judge Malcolm O'Hara, Garrison won with 60 percent of the vote.",
          "Kennedy assassination investigation": "As New Orleans D.A., in late 1966, Garrison began an investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, after receiving several tips from Jack Martin that a man named David Ferrie may have been involved in the assassination.[14] The result of Garrison's investigation was the arrest and trial of New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw in 1969, with Shaw being unanimously acquitted less than one hour after the case went to the jury.[15][16][17] Garrison was able to subpoena the Zapruder film from Life magazine. Thus, members of the American public – i.e., the jurors of the case – were shown the movie for the first time. Until the trial, the film rarely had been seen, and copies were made by assassination investigator Steve Jaffe, who was working with Garrison's office. In 2015, Garrison's lead investigator's daughter released his copy of the film, along with a number of his personal papers from the investigation.[18]\n\nGarrison's key witness against Shaw was Perry Russo, a 25-year-old insurance salesman from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. At the trial, Russo testified that he had attended a party at anti-Castro activist David Ferrie's apartment. At the party, Russo said that Lee Harvey Oswald (whom Russo said was introduced to him as \"Leon Oswald\"), David Ferrie, and \"Clem Bertrand\" (whom Russo identified in the courtroom as Clay Shaw) had discussed killing President Kennedy.[19] The conversation included plans for the \"triangulation of crossfire\" and alibis for the participants.[19]\n\nRusso's version of events has been questioned by some historians and researchers, such as Patricia Lambert, once it became known that part of his testimony might have been induced by hypnosis and by the drug sodium pentothal (sometimes called \"truth serum\").[20] An early version of Russo's testimony (as told in Assistant D.A. Andrew Sciambra's memo, before Russo was subjected to sodium pentothal and hypnosis) fails to mention an \"assassination party\" and says that Russo met Shaw on two occasions, neither of which occurred at the party.[21][22] However, in his book On the Trail of the Assassins, Garrison says that Russo had already discussed the party at Ferrie's apartment before any \"truth serum\" was administered.[23] Scambria said that the party information was simply accidentally left off the notes of his encounter with Russo. Throughout his life, Russo reiterated the same account of being present for a party at Ferrie's house along with Mr. Bertrand, where the subject of Kennedy's potential assassination had come up.[24][25] Garrison defended his conduct regarding witness testimony, stating:\n\nBefore we introduced the testimony of our witnesses, we made them undergo independent verifying tests, including polygraph examination, truth serum and hypnosis. We thought this would be hailed as an unprecedented step in jurisprudence; instead, the press turned around and hinted that we had drugged our witnesses or given them posthypnotic suggestions to testify falsely.[26]\n\nIn January 1968, Garrison subpoenaed Kerry Wendell Thornley – an acquaintance of Oswald's from their days in the military – to appear before a grand jury, questioning him about his relationship with Oswald and his knowledge of other figures that Garrison believed were connected to the assassination.[27] Thornley sought a cancellation of this subpoena on which he had to appear before the Circuit Court.[28] Garrison charged Thornley with perjury after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald in any manner since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison's successor, Harry Connick Sr. Also in 1968, Mort Sahl used his connection to get Garrison a spot on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson to discuss the assassination.[29]\n\nDuring Garrison's 1973 bribery trial, tape recordings from March 1971 revealed that Garrison considered implicating publicly the former United States Air Force General and Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Charles Cabell, of conspiracy in the assassination of Kennedy after learning that he was the brother of Earle Cabell, the Dallas mayor in 1963.[30] Theorizing that a plot to kill the president was masterminded out of New Orleans in conjunction with the CIA, with cooperation from the Dallas police department and city government, Garrison allegedly tasked his former chief investigator, Pershing Gervais, to look into the possibility that General Cabell had stayed in the city's Fontainebleau Motel at the time of the assassination.[30] The Washington Post reported that there was no evidence that Gervais ever followed through with the request and that there was no further mention of General Cabell in Garrison's investigation. The article also noted that, by the date in question, Gervais was no longer working for the district attorney in New Orleans.[30]\n\nA U.S. talk-radio host, David Mendelsohn, conducted a comprehensive interview with Garrison that was broadcast in 1988 by KPFA in Berkeley, California. Alongside Garrison, the program featured the voices of Lee Harvey Oswald and JFK filmmaker Oliver Stone. Garrison explained that cover stories were circulated in an attempt to blame the killing on the Cubans and the Mafia, but that he blames the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy firmly on the CIA, which wanted to continue the Cold War.[31] The very same reasonings as to why he thought that President Kennedy was killed were espoused by Garrison in filmed television appearances that he would make leading up to his death, the year after Stone's release of his cinematic film JFK, largely based on Garrison's pioneering role in the lone prosecution in the case of President Kennedy's assassination.",
          "Later career and death": "In 1973, Garrison was tried and found not guilty by the jury for accepting bribes to protect illegal pinball machine operations.[32] In an interview with Pershing Gervais conducted by New Orleans reporter Rosemary James, Gervais had admitted to concocting the charges.[33] In the same year, Garrison was defeated for reelection as district attorney by Harry Connick Sr. On April 15, 1978, Garrison won a special election over a Republican candidate, Thomas F. Jordan, for Louisiana's 4th Circuit Court of Appeal judgeship, a position for which he was later reelected and which he held until his death.[34]\n\nIn 1987, Garrison appeared in the film The Big Easy where he essentially played himself, and the next year he was featured in The Men Who Killed Kennedy series, airing in the United States beginning in 1988. After the Shaw trial, Garrison wrote three books on the Kennedy assassination, A Heritage of Stone (1970), The Star Spangled Contract (1976, fiction but based on the JFK assassination), and his best-seller, On the Trail of the Assassins (1988). A Heritage of Stone, published by Putnam, places responsibility for the assassination on the CIA and says the Warren Commission, the Executive Branch, members of the Dallas Police Department, the pathologists at Bethesda, and various others lied to the American public.[35] The book does not mention Shaw or Garrison's investigation of Shaw.[35]\n\nGarrison's investigation received widespread attention through Oliver Stone's film, JFK (1991),[36] which was largely based on Garrison's book as well as Jim Marrs' Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy.[37][38] Kevin Costner played a fictionalized version of Garrison in the movie. Garrison himself had a small on-screen role in the film, playing United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren. Garrison also appears live and comments on the Shaw Trial in the documentary The JFK Assassination: The Jim Garrison Tapes, written and directed by actor John Barbour. Garrison died in 1992 and is survived by his five children.[39][40] He is interred at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.[41]",
          "Legacy": "Garrison's investigation and trial of Shaw has been described by critics as \"a fatally flawed case built on flimsy evidence that featured a chorus of dubious and even wacky witnesses\".[42] Political commentator George Will wrote that Garrison \"staged an assassination 'investigation' that involved recklessness, cruelty, abuse of power, publicity mongering and dishonesty, all on a scale that strongly suggested lunacy leavened by cynicism.\"[43] Former Orleans Parish district attorney Harry Connick Sr. said it was \"a travesty of justice\",[42] and that he \"thought it was one of the grossest, most extreme miscarriages of justice in the annals of American judicial history.\"[44] Journalist Max Holland also described the investigation of Shaw as an \"egregious miscarriage of justice\".[45]\n\nOthers who have called Garrison's case against Shaw a \"miscarriage of justice\" or \"travesty of justice\" include historian Alecia Long,[46] as well as journalist Gerald Posner.[47] Conspiracy researcher Harold Weisberg called it a \"tragedy\".[48] Political analyst and conspiracy believer Carl Oglesby was quoted as saying to \"have done a study of Garrison: I come out of it thinking that he is one of the really first-rate class-act heroes of this whole ugly story [the killing of John F. Kennedy and subsequent investigation].\"[49] Conspiracy author David Lifton called Garrison \"intellectually dishonest, a reckless prosecutor, and a total charlatan\".[50] At the time, Garrison came under criticism from author and researcher Sylvia Meagher, who in 1967 wrote that \"as the Garrison investigation continued to unfold, it gave cause for increasingly serious misgivings about the validity of his evidence, the credibility of his witnesses, and the scrupulousness of his methods.[51] According to Shaw's defense team, witnesses, including Russo, claimed to have been bribed and threatened with perjury and contempt of court charges by Garrison in order to make his case against Shaw.[52]",

He joined the 42 Gang as a teenager, developing a reputation in organized crime, which gained him the notice of the leaders of the Chicago Outfit, which he joined during the late 1930s. From the 1940s through the 1950s, he controlled illegal gambling, illegal liquor distribution, and political rackets in Louisiana. In the early 1940s, Giancana was involved in a takeover of Chicago's black American lottery payout system for the Outfit. In 1957, he became the boss of the Chicago Outfit.\n\nAccording to some sources, Giancana and the Mafia were involved in John F. Kennedy's victory in the 1960 presidential election. During the 1960s, he was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a plot to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Conspiracy theorists consider Giancana, along with Mafia leaders Santo Trafficante Jr. and Carlos Marcello, to be associated with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In 1965, Giancana was convicted of contempt of court, serving one year in prison. After his release from prison, Giancana fled to Cuernavaca, Mexico. In 1974, he was deported to the United States, returning to Chicago. Giancana was murdered on June 19, 1975, in Oak Park, Illinois, shortly before he was scheduled to appear before the Church Committee.",
          "Early life": "Giancana was born Gilormo Giangana[nb 1] on May 24, 1908,[nb 2] in The Patch neighborhood of Chicago to Antonio Giangana and Antonia DeSimmona,[nb 3] Italian immigrants from Castelvetrano, Sicily. His father immigrated in 1905, while his mother immigrated in 1906;[11] he had seven siblings.[6] Antonia died in 1910 and his father married Mary Leonardi.[12]",
          "Criminal career": "Giancana joined the 42 Gang, a juvenile street crew working for political boss Joseph Esposito. The 42 Gang's name was a reference to Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves. They thought they were one better, hence 42. Giancana soon developed a reputation as an excellent getaway driver, a high earner, and a vicious killer. After Esposito's murder, in which Giancana was allegedly involved, the 42 Gang was transformed into a de facto extension of the Chicago Outfit with leaders such as Frank \"the Enforcer\" Nitti, Paul \"the Waiter\" Ricca, and Tony \"Joe Batters\" Accardo. He was first arrested in 1925 for auto theft. He soon graduated to \"triggerman\" and by the age of 20 had been the prime subject of three murder investigations but never tried for any of them.[13] In 1929, Giancana was convicted of burglary and larceny, and sentenced to one to five years in the Joliet Correctional Center. He was released in 1932 after serving three years and nine months.[14]\n\nDuring the late 1930s, Giancana became the first 42er to join the Chicago Outfit. From the early 1940s through the 1950s, he controlled most illegal gambling, liquor distribution, and other political rackets in Louisiana through longtime friend H. A. (Hol) Killian. Killian controlled the majority of the liquor license issuance by his associations with longtime New Orleans business associate Carlos Marcello.[citation needed] In 1939, Giancana was convicted of bootlegging and sentenced to four years in Leavenworth Prison and Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex.[14]",
          "Rise to power": "After his release from prison in 1942, Giancana made a name for himself by convincing Accardo, then the Outfit's underboss, to stage a takeover of Chicago's African American \"policy\" (lottery) payout system for the Outfit. Giancana's crew is believed to have convinced Eddie Jones to quit his racket and leave the country. Giancana's crew was also responsible for the August 4, 1952, murder of African American gambling boss Theodore Roe. Jones and Roe were major South Side gambling bosses. Roe had refused to surrender control of his operation as the Outfit had demanded, and on June 19, 1951, Roe fatally shot Leonard \"Fat Lennie\" Caifano, a made man of Giancana's crew.[15]\n\nThe Outfit's South Side \"policy\"-game takeover was not complete until another Outfit member, Jackie \"the Lackey\" Cerone, scared \"Big Jim\" Martin to Mexico with two bullets to the head that did not kill him. When the lottery money started rolling in for the Outfit after this gambling war, the amount this game produced for the Outfit was in the millions of dollars a year, bringing Giancana further notice. It is believed to have been a major factor in his being \"anointed\" as the Outfit's new boss in 1957. Accardo joined Ricca in semi-retirement, becoming the Outfit's consigliere.[16] However, it was generally understood that Accardo and Ricca still had the real power. Giancana was required to consult Accardo and Ricca on all important Outfit affairs.\n\nGiancana was present at the Mafia's 1957 Apalachin meeting at the Upstate New York estate of Joseph Barbara.[17] Later, Buffalo crime boss Stefano Magaddino and Giancana were overheard on a wiretap saying the meeting should have occurred in the Chicago area. Giancana claimed that the Chicago area was \"the safest place in the world\" for a major underworld meeting because he had several police chiefs on his payroll. If the syndicate ever wanted to hold a meeting in or around Chicago, Giancana said, they had nothing to fear because they had the area \"locked up tight\".[18]\n\nHyman Larner was an associate of Giancana's who helped expand the Outfit's gambling and smuggling operations to Panama and Iran,[19] moving the Miami operation's headquarters to Panama where money laundering was more easily facilitated by local banks. These operations were conducted as a partnership between the Mafia and the CIA. By 1966, this partnership had developed into arms smuggling to the Middle East for the Israeli Mossad, all via Panama.[20] Richard Cain, a corrupt police officer, also made \"frequent trips\" to and from Mexico as Giancana's courier and financial adviser.[21]",
          "1960 Presidential election": "Some journalists claimed that Giancana and his Chicago crime syndicate \"played a role\" in John F. Kennedy's victory in the 1960 presidential election.[22][23]\n\nAccording to Giancana mistress Judith Exner and Frank Sinatra's daughter Tina Sinatra, Giancana used his connections to persuade unions to support Kennedy.[24][25] According to Exner, Giancana bragged to her that Kennedy would never have been elected without him.[25] However, it's alleged that Giancana came to regret aiding Kennedy get elected due to the fact that attorney general Robert F. Kennedy made significant efforts to crack down on organized crime.[26][24]",
          "CIA connections": "It is widely reputed and was partially corroborated by the Church Committee hearings that during the Kennedy administration, the CIA recruited Giancana and other mobsters to assassinate Fidel Castro. Giancana reportedly said that CIA and the Cosa Nostra were \"different sides of the same coin\".[27]\n\nJudith Exner claimed to be the mistress of both Giancana and JFK, and that she delivered communications between them about Castro.[28] Giancana's daughter Antoinette has stated that her father was performing a scam to pocket millions of CIA dollars.[29]\n\nDocuments released in 1997 revealed that some Mafiosi worked with CIA on assassination attempts against Castro.[30] CIA documents released in 2007 confirmed that in September 1960, the CIA recruited ex-FBI agent Robert Maheu to meet with the West Coast representative of the Chicago mob, Johnny Roselli. When Maheu contacted Roselli, Maheu hid that he was sent by the CIA, instead portraying himself as an advocate for international corporations. He offered $150,000 to have Castro killed, but Roselli refused any pay. Roselli introduced Maheu to two men he called Sam Gold and Joe. \"Sam Gold\" was Giancana; \"Joe\" was Santo Trafficante Jr., the Tampa syndicate boss and one of the most powerful mobsters in prerevolution Cuba.[31] Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post explained: \"After Fidel Castro led a revolution that toppled the government of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, CIA was desperate to eliminate Castro. So, the agency sought out a partner equally worried about Castro—the Mafia, which had lucrative investments in Cuban casinos.\"[32]\n\nAccording to the declassified CIA \"Family Jewels\" documents, Giancana and Trafficante were contacted in September 1960 about the possibility of an assassination attempt by Maheu after Maheu had contacted Roselli, a Mafia member in Las Vegas and Giancana's number-two man. Maheu had presented himself as a representative of numerous international businesses in Cuba that Castro was expropriating. He offered $150,000 for the \"removal\" of Castro through this operation, though the documents suggest that neither Roselli, Giancana, nor Trafficante accepted any payment for the job. Giancana suggested using poison pills to dose Castro's food and drink. CIA gave these pills to Giancana's nominee, Juan Orta, whom Giancana presented as a corrupt official in the new Cuban government and who had access to Castro. After six attempts to introduce the poison into Castro's food, Orta abruptly demanded to be relieved of his role in the mission, giving the job to another, unnamed participant. Later, Giancana and Trafficante made a second attempt using Anthony Verona, the commander of the Cuban Exile Junta, who had, according to Trafficante, become \"disaffected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the Junta.\" Verona requested $10,000 in expenses and $1,000 worth of communications equipment. How much work was performed for the second attempt is unknown, as the program was canceled soon after due to the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961.[33][34][35]\n\nAccording to the \"Family Jewels\", Giancana asked Maheu to wire the room of his then mistress Phyllis McGuire, singer of the McGuire Sisters, whom he suspected of having an affair with comedian Dan Rowan. Although documents suggest Maheu acquiesced, the device was not planted because the agent who had been given the task of planting it was arrested. According to the documents, Robert F. Kennedy prohibited the prosecution of the agent and Maheu, who was soon linked to the wire attempt, at the CIA's request.[35] Giancana and McGuire, who had a long-lasting affair, were originally introduced by Frank Sinatra.[36] According to Antoinette Giancana, during part of the affair, McGuire had a concurrent affair with President Kennedy.[37]",
          "Downfall": "When Giancana was called before a grand jury on June 1, 1965, he remained silent despite having been granted immunity, which resulted in his jailing for contempt for more than a year, the duration of the grand jury.[38] Meanwhile, Giancana was deposed as operational boss by Ricca and Accardo, and replaced by Joseph \"Joey Doves\" Aiuppa.[39]\n\nAfter his release from prison in 1966, Giancana fled to Cuernavaca, Mexico, to avoid further grand jury questioning.[40][41] He was arrested by Mexican authorities on July 19, 1974, and deported to the United States.[40][41] He arrived back in Chicago on July 21, 1974.[42]",
          "Personal life": "One of the most violent criminals in U.S. history, Giancana acquired the nickname \"Momo,\" from the slang term \"mooner,\" meaning \"madman.\"[4] - encyclopedia.com\n\nGiancana signed a card to his wife as \"Mooney\".[3]\n\nOn 23 September 1933[2], Giancana married Angeline DeTolve, the daughter of immigrants from the Italian region of Basilicata, while living in The Island, Chicago.[1] They had three daughters: Antoinette,[43] born 1935; Bonnie Lou[44] (La Bonita[1]), born 1938; and Francine,[45] born 1945.[6] In 1945, they bought a house in Oak Park, Illinois.[46][47][48] On 23 April 1954, Angeline died, leaving him to raise his three daughters.[6][43]\n\nIn summer 1963, Giancana stayed with Phyllis McGuire in one of the Cal-Neva Lodge chalets while the McGuire Sisters were there to perform in the Celebrity Room, which led to a scandal that cost Frank Sinatra his ownership in the Cal-Neva, as well as his part ownership in the Sands Hotel.[49][50]",
          "Death": "After Giancana's return to the United States, police detailed officers to guard his house in Oak Park, Illinois, but on the night of June 19, 1975, shortly before he was scheduled to appear before the Church Committee,[51] which was investigating CIA and Cosa Nostra collusion,[52] a gunman entered the home through the basement and shot Giancana in the head and neck seven times with a .22 caliber pistol. At around 11 p.m., Joseph DiPersio, Giancana's caretaker, found his body on the floor of the basement kitchen where he was said to be frying sausage and peppers.[53][54] A week before his death, Giancana had gall bladder surgery in Houston.[53]\n\nWithin days of Giancana's murder, Michael J. Corbitt, the police chief of Willow Springs, Illinois, and a mobster associate, was told by Chicago Outfit's capo Salvatore Bastone that \"Sam sure loved that little guy in Oak Park... Tony Spilotro. Yeah, he was fuckin' crazy about him. Sam put Tony on the fuckin' map, thought he was gonna be a big fuckin' man someday. Did you know that after Marshall Caifano got out of Vegas, it was Sam who wanted Tony Spilotro out there? Even lately, with all the problems with the skim and all, Sam always stood behind the guy. Tony was over to Sam's house all the time. He lived right by there. Did you know Tony even figured out a way where he could get in through the back of Sam's place without anybody seeing him? He'd go through other people's yards, go over fences, all sorts of shit.\"[55] When Corbitt asked for the reason for the murder, Bastone quipped, \"There's never just one reason for shit like what happened to Sam. There's a million of 'em. Let's just say that Sam should've remembered what happened to Bugsy Siegel.\"[55]",
          "Other theories": "Although longtime associate Dominic \"Butch\" Blasi was with Giancana the night he was murdered and questioned by police as a suspect, neither the FBI nor Antoinette Giancana considers him Giancana's killer.[56][57] Hitman Nicholas Calabrese told the FBI during the 2000s that he knew that Tony Accardo was part of the killing and Angelo LaPietra got rid of the gun which used a suppressor made by Frank Calabrese Sr. and Ronnie Jarret.[58]\n\nAnother theory is that Santo Trafficante Jr. ordered Giancana's murder due to fears he would testify about the Mafia's involvement in CIA plots to kill Castro. Although Trafficante would have needed permission from Outfit bosses Accardo and Joseph Aiuppa, Giancana's murder coincided with the discovery of the decomposing remains of Johnny Roselli in an oil drum floating off Miami; he had been shot and chopped up before being dumped in the sea. Some suspected that Roselli was killed on Trafficante's orders.[59]\n\nThere were rumors that the CIA may have killed Giancana because of his links to the Agency.[citation needed]. Former CIA Director William Colby said, \"We had nothing to do with it.\"[60] John Whitten mentioned during the Scelso deposition that he suspected William Harvey, a CIA assassin who was in the area.[citation needed]",

By 1946 he was at WHBY in Appleton, Wisconsin, and soon worked as program director at WLIP in Kenosha, Wisconsin. By 1957 he worked in Chicago at WBBM, then at WLS in 1959, and at WGN in 1970 from where he retired in 1981. He was a ten-year board member of AFTRA, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\nIn 1985, Jerome appeared as a contestant on The Price Is Right and, notably, won the game Ten Chances with only three guesses (The fewest necessary to win, and was the first contestant to perform this feat).\n\n^ Childers, Scott (2008).

He served as auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Washington from 1956 to 1965 and as the eleventh archbishop of the Archdiocese of New Orleans in Louisiana from 1965 to 1988.",
          "Early life": "Philip Hannan was born on May 20, 1913, in Washington, D.C.[1] His father, Patrick Francis Hannan, immigrated to the United States at age 18 and was nicknamed \"The Boss\". His mother was Lillian Hannan.[2] Patrick Hannan found work as a plumber, building his trade into a flourishing business that weathered even the Great Depression.[3]\n\nPhilip Hannan attended St. John's College High School in Washington. He captained the winning cadet company in his senior year there. Before high school graduation, he surprised his family by saying that instead of taking the entrance exam to gain admittance into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he would become a priest. He then began college studies at St. Charles College in Catonsville, Maryland, and then at the Sulpician Seminary at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.[citation needed]\n\nAfter graduating from Catholic University in 1936 with a master's degree, Hannan traveled to Rome to study at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. Hannan received a Licentiate of Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and later earned a Doctor of Canon Law degree from Catholic University.[2]",
          "Priesthood": "While in Rome, Hannan was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Baltimore-Washington by Ralph Hayes on December 8, 1939.[1]\n\nIn the summer of 1940, due to World War II, all American seminarians were ordered to leave Italy by the U.S. Secretary of State, prompting Hannan to return to Washington. He would later write a book, Rome: Living under the Axis, detailing his experiences under the Fascist Regime in Italy.[citation needed]\n\nAfter returning to Washington, Hannan was assigned as curate at St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in Baltimore, Maryland.[4]",
          "World War II": "After the entry of the United States into World War II, Hannan joined the United States Army and was commissioned as an officer and chaplain to the 82nd Airborne Division. He ministered to the paratroopers during the fighting in the Ardennes Offensive in Belgium. Hannan witnessed the liberation of starved prisoners at the Wöbbelin concentration camp in Ludwigslust, Germany.[5][2]\n\nAfter his discharge from the army, Hannan served briefly as pastor of Cologne Cathedral Parish in Cologne, Germany, during the American occupation.[6][7]\n\nAfter returning to Washington, Hannan was assigned as an assistant priest at Saint Mary Mother of God Parish.[8] When the Archdiocese of Washington was split from the Archdiocese of Baltimore on November 15, 1947, Hannan was incardinated, or transferred to the Archdiocese of Washington. In 1948, he was appointed vice chancellor of that archdiocese. While he was vice chancellor, Hannan met then Congressman John F. Kennedy. For the next 14 years, Hannan would serve as an unofficial advisor to Kennedy on matters of religion and social justices.[2]\n\nIn 1951, Hannan established the Catholic Standard in Washington and served as its editor-in-chief. Later that year he was named chancellor of the archdiocese, and Pope Pius XII honored Hannan in 1952 by naming him a monsignor.",
          "Auxiliary Bishop of Washington": "Pope Pius XII named Hannan on June 16, 1956. as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Washington and titular bishop of Hieropolis; he was consecrated in the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle on August 28, 1956.[1] Hannan was part of the U.S. delegation to the Second Vatican Council, where he served as a press officer.\n\nHannan was in Rome for the Second Vatican Council in November 1963 when news reached him about the assassination of President Kennedy, forcing his immediate return to Washington. At Kennedy's state funeral mass, Cardinal Richard Cushing was the principal celebrant. The Kennedy family asked Hannan to deliver the homily at the \"low\" or recited Requiem Mass.[9][2] This responsibility normally would have fallen to the Archbishop of Washington at the time, Patrick O'Boyle, but he allowed Hannan to perform it.[10]",
          "Archbishop of New Orleans": "During the Fourth Session of Vatican II, specifically on September 29, 1965, Hannan was appointed as the eleventh archbishop of New Orleans, succeeding Archbishop John Cody (later Cardinal), who had been transferred to Chicago. He moved to New Orleans only weeks after Hurricane Betsy hit the city, and he became a spiritual leader during the rebuilding of both the city and the archdiocese.\n\nHe presided over the New Orleans archdiocese during a time of great change. The Second Vatican Council concluded on December 8, 1965, and Archbishop Hannan led the effort to implement the council's policies of reform within the archdiocese. Hannan instituted a Social Apostolate program in 1966 which now provides over 20 million pounds of free food each year to 42,000 needy women, children and elderly. He also reformed the Archdiocesan Catholic Charities system, which now serves as the largest non-governmental social service agency in the New Orleans metropolitan area.\n\nAt the same time, the demographics of the city were changing, as Catholic whites moved to the suburbs, while Orleans Parish became increasingly Protestant. New churches and parishes were being built throughout the city, while attendance in inner-city churches declined.[11] At a time when other swimming pools in the New Orleans area were racially segregated, he opened the pool at Notre Dame Seminary to the entire public.[2]\n\nIn 1968, Hannan returned to Washington from New Orleans to deliver the graveside eulogy for Senator Robert F. Kennedy.[2] Hannan was archbishop when Pope John Paul II made his apostolic visit to New Orleans between September 11 and 13, 1987, the first ever papal visit to the city. Hannan, who considered the visit the highlight of his tenure as Archbishop, was the Pontiff's personal guide throughout his three-day tour of the city.[12][13]",
          "Retirement": "In May 1988, upon reaching his 75th birthday, Hannan submitted his resignation as Archbishop of New Orleans. This resignation was accepted by Pope John Paul II on December 6, 1988, when Hannan was succeeded as archbishop by Francis Schulte.\n\nIn 1994 Hannan offered graveside prayers at the interment of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis in Arlington National Cemetery.[2] During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hannan remained at a studio in a Catholic television station he had founded in Metairie, in order to protect it from looting. In the aftermath of Katrina, Hannan participated personally in the clean-up effort. In May 2010, Our Sunday Visitor Publishing published Hannan's memoirs in The Archbishop Wore Combat Boots – From Combat, to Camelot, to Katrina: A Memoir of an Extraordinary Life by Archbishop Philip Hannan with Nancy Collins and Peter Finney Jr. ISBN 978-1-59276-697-0.",
          "Death and legacy": "Philip Hannan died on September 29, 2011, at the age of 98 at Chateau de Notre Dame. He had moved there, from his private residence in Covington, Louisiana, in June 2011; he had grown increasingly frail in his last months because of a series of strokes and other health problems.[14][15]\n\nHannan received numerous civic honors, including the most prestigious award presented to a New Orleans civic leader, The Times-Picayune Loving Cup. In 1987, the Catholic University of America named its new science center Hannan Hall and conferred upon him the honorary Doctor of Laws. He also held an honorary Doctor of Laws from Georgetown University.\n\nIn 1987, the first Roman Catholic school in St. Bernard Parish was opened and the people of the parish asked that it be named Archbishop Hannan High School in his honor. After the original campus was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, the school relocated and opened a new campus in St. Tammany Parish in 2008.[16]",
          "Abortion rights": "In 1996, Hannan publicly opposed the election of Democrat Mary Landrieu, a Roman Catholic whose family had been Hannan's longtime friends, to the United States Senate. Although stopping short of endorsing (or even mentioning) Landrieu's Republican opponent, Woody Jenkins, the retired archbishop had become concerned, as he explained, by the endorsement of Landrieu by Emily's List.[17][18] Hannan's 1996 declaration has been cited as influential on later Catholic prelates involving themselves in politics by issuing warning statements about pro-abortion rights Catholic politicians and in barring them from communion.[19]\n\nOn November 27, 2008, from his home in Covington, the retired archbishop published his \"Thanksgiving and Christmas Blessings\" in the New Orleans Times-Picayune. The full-page announcement was mostly an anti-abortion appeal expressing particular concern over the potential threat that the \"evil\" Freedom of Choice Act might be passed into law by the incoming United States Congress and the administration of President Barack Obama. The ad cited the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade and, quoting the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, warns that \"a bad court decision will be enshrined in bad legislation that is more radical than the decision itself.\"[20]",
          "Nuclear arms": "Hannan was the leader of a minority of bishops who opposed the May 3, 1983, pastoral letter of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops entitled The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response. The letter opposed the concept of nuclear deterrence and advocated a nuclear freeze with the Soviet Union.[2]\n\n^\na b c \"Archbishop Philip Matthew Hannan [Catholic-Hierarchy]\". catholic-hierarchy.org.

Wood Jr., the first federal judge to be assassinated in the 20th century. Charles Harrelson was the father of actors Brett and Woody Harrelson.[2]",
          "Personal life": "Charles Harrelson was born on July 23, 1938, in Lovelady, Texas,[3] the son of Alma Lee (née Sparks; 1907–2002) and Voyde Harrelson (1901–1976).\n\nHe was married to Nancy Hillman Harrelson, Diane Lou Oswald, Jo Ann Harrelson, and Gina Adelle Foster. Harrelson worked as an encyclopedia salesman in California, and as a professional gambler. In 1960, he was convicted of armed robbery. Harrelson later admitted that he had been involved in dozens of murders beginning in the early 1960s.[4]\n\nHarrelson's son, Woodrow Tracy Harrelson (born July 23, 1961), is actor Woody Harrelson. According to Woody, his father disappeared from the family's home in Houston in 1968, leaving his wife Diane to raise Woody and his two brothers. Woody lost track of his father until 1981, when news broke of Harrelson's arrest for the murder of Judge Wood. During an interview in November 1988, Woody revealed that he visited his father regularly in federal prison, although he still harbored mixed feelings about him, saying:\n\nMy father is one of the most articulate, well-read, charming people I've ever known. Still, I'm just now gauging whether he merits my loyalty or friendship. I look at him as someone who could be a friend more than someone who was a father.[5]\n\nIn April 2023, actor Matthew McConaughey claimed that he and Woody Harrelson, who have been long-time friends, could potentially be half-brothers, implying that Charles Harrelson could also be his father. According to McConaughey, his mother claimed to have known Woody's father around the time that McConaughey was conceived, and the two actors have discussed taking a DNA test to be certain.[6]",
          "Murder of Alan Harry Berg": "Defended by Percy Foreman, Harrelson was tried for the 1968 murder of Alan Harry Berg. On September 22, 1970, he was acquitted by a jury in Angleton, Texas.[7] The murder is chronicled in the memoir Run Brother Run by the victim's brother, David Berg.[8]",
          "Murder of Sam Degelia": "Harrelson was tried for the 1968 murder-for-hire killing of Sam Degelia Jr., a resident of Hearne, Texas. Harrelson was paid $2,000 (the equivalent of $18,000 in 2020) for the murder of Degelia, a grain dealer and father of four who was killed in McAllen, Texas.[9] His first trial ended with a deadlocked jury,[9] although Pete Scamardo, who was also tried in the case, was found guilty of being an accomplice to the murder,[10] and sentenced to seven years probation.[11][12] Harrelson was retried in 1973, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in prison.[13] In 1978, after serving five years, he was released early for good behavior.[13]",
          "Murder of Judge John H. Wood Jr.": "Shortly after Harrelson was paroled in 1978, he and his then-wife, Jo Ann, were implicated in another murder. On May 29, 1979, U.S. district judge John H. Wood Jr. was shot dead in the parking lot outside his San Antonio, Texas, townhouse.[14][15] Harrelson was convicted of killing Judge Wood after being hired by drug dealer Jamiel Chagra of El Paso, Texas. Wood—nicknamed \"Maximum John\" because of his reputation for handing down long sentences for drug offenses—was originally scheduled to have Chagra appear before him on the day of his murder, but the trial had been delayed.[16]\n\nHarrelson was apprehended when calls were made to the police saying he was firing a gun at imaginary FBI agents while on drugs. With the aid of an anonymous tip and a tape recording of a conversation that occurred during a visit from Joe Chagra to his brother Jamiel Chagra in prison, Harrelson was charged with Judge Wood's murder. Harrelson claimed at trial that he did not kill Judge Wood, but merely took credit for it so he could claim a large payment from Chagra.\n\nHarrelson was sentenced to two life terms based largely on Chagra's conversation with his brother from prison. Both Harrelson and Joe Chagra were implicated in the assassination, and Chagra received a ten-year sentence as part of a plea bargain to testify for the prosecution but not against his brother. In the absence of Joe's testimony, Jamiel Chagra was acquitted of the murder. Jamiel was represented by the future mayor of Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman, then a public defender. In a plea bargain, Jamiel admitted to his role in the murder of Judge Wood and to the attempted murder of a U.S. attorney. Harrelson's wife, Jo Ann, was sentenced to consecutive terms totaling 25 years on multiple convictions of conspiracy and perjury related to the assassination.[17]\n\nIn 2003, Chagra recanted his previous statements, stating that someone other than Harrelson had shot Judge Wood.[4] Harrelson's son, Woody, then attempted to have his father's conviction overturned in order to secure a new trial, although without success.[18] Chagra died in July 2008 of cancer.[19]",
          "Allegations of involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy": "In September 1980, Harrelson surrendered to police after a six-hour standoff in which he was reportedly high on cocaine.[20][21] During the standoff, he threatened suicide and stated that he had killed both Judge Wood and President John F. Kennedy.[20][22] In a television interview after his arrest, Harrelson said: \"At the same time I said I had killed the judge, I said I had killed Kennedy, which might give you an idea to the state of my mind at the time.\" He said that the statements made during the standoff were \"an effort to elongate my life.\"[23]\n\nJoseph Chagra later testified during Harrelson's trial that Harrelson claimed to have shot Kennedy and drew maps to show where he was hiding during the assassination. Chagra said that he did not believe Harrelson's claim, and the AP reported that the FBI \"apparently discounted any involvement by Harrelson in the Kennedy assassination.\"[24] According to Jim Marrs' 1989 book Crossfire, some theorists believe Harrelson is the youngest and tallest of the \"three tramps\" arrested shortly after Kennedy's shooting in Dallas.[21] Marrs stated that Harrelson was involved \"with criminals connected to intelligence agencies and the military\" and suggested that he was connected to Jack Ruby through Russell Douglas Matthews, a third party with links to organized crime who was known to both Harrelson and Ruby.[22] Lois Gibson, a well-known forensic artist, matched photographs of Harrelson to the photographs of the youngest-looking of the three \"tramps\".[25][26]\n\nIn 1982, Harrelson told Dallas TV station KDFW-TV, \"Do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy, alone, without any aid from a rogue agency of the U.S. government or at least a portion of that agency? I believe you are very naive if you do.\"[27]",
          "Escape attempt": "On July 4, 1995, Harrelson and two other inmates, Gary Settle and Michael Rivers, attempted to escape from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary using a makeshift rope. A warning shot was fired at them from the prison's tower, and the trio surrendered.[28] Harrelson was subsequently transferred to supermax prison ADX Florence in Colorado. In a letter to a friend, Harrelson wrote that he enjoyed his life inside the maximum security facility, writing that \"there are not enough hours in a day for my needs as a matter of fact ... The silence is wonderful.\"[29]",
          "Death": "On March 15, 2007, Harrelson was found dead in his cell, having died at the age of 68 from a heart attack.[2][30]",
          "Media": "In Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel No Country for Old Men, set in 1980, the sheriff states, \"Here a while back in San Antonio they shot and killed a federal judge\", referencing the murder of Judge John H. Wood Jr. by Harrelson. His son Woody Harrelson acted in the 2007 film adaptation of the novel, which premiered two months after the elder Harrelson's death.\n\nA 10-episode podcast titled Son of a Hitman[31] was released on May 5, 2020, by Spotify Studios and produced by High Five Content. It is produced and hosted by journalist Jason Cavanagh and investigates the legitimacy of the three murder charges for which Charles Harrelson was tried as well as the possibility that he may have been involved with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.[32]\n\n^ Robbins, Maro; Guillermo Contreras (March 21, 2007). \"Judge Wood's assassin dies of heart attack\". San Antonio Express-News. Archived from the original on March 26, 2007.

          "Lead": "Gilbert V. Hartke OP (January 16, 1907 – February 21, 1986) was an American director, playwright, and priest of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans). He was founder of The Catholic University of America's Department of Speech and Drama, one of the first university drama programs in America. Hartke developed his curriculum during a time when drama was not considered a discipline in Catholic universities.[1]\n\nHe directed over 60 major productions at CUA and several more for the National Players, a touring company he created. He secured the Olney Theatre, a summer stock playhouse in Olney, Maryland as a base for the Players. He invited his friend Helen Hayes and other notables to star in productions at Olney.\n\nHe wrote five plays, and toured his students on five continents and across the United States. He recruited playwright Leo Brady, director Alan Schneider and theatrical designer James Waring to the faculty. He also enlisted the assistance of Josephine McGarry Callan, a vocal coach, who was particularly noted for the excellence of the choral speaking she supervised in campus productions of Greek tragedy, and such plays as T.S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral.\n\nAlso known as the \"show-biz priest\", Hartke, a onetime college football player, was not a conventional Dominican friar. Still, he occupied a monk's cell in the Dominican House of Studies across the street from CUA, and often led students in praying the rosary at a little shrine in the entrance courtyard of the building housing the Speech and Drama Department. With his deep dramatic voice, athlete's frame, full head of silver hair, and often dressed in his white Dominican robes, Hartke was an arresting presence.\n\nWell-known and highly regarded in social, business and political circles, he played an active role in the fight against racial discrimination in Washington, D.C., and served on the board of the revived Ford's Theatre. He was close friend and confidante to actors, politicians, and presidents.\n\nIn 1963, he was one of two Catholic priests (the other being Robert Paul Mohan) dispatched to the White House from the CUA to remain with the body of assassinated President John F. Kennedy until the official funeral, as requested by his widow.\n\nIn 1978, Princess Grace of Monaco visited the university to prepare for a poetry reading for the American Wildlife Fund. Geraldine Page and Rip Torn were among the many other artists who, at Hartke's request, came on campus to speak directly with students. His longtime friend Helen Hayes made her final stage appearance in CUA's on-campus Hartke Theatre, in Eugene O'Neill's classic Long Day's Journey into Night.\n\nHartke was also known for his creative generosity. When his students hit financial straits, he would first make sure they would work for their scholarships and loans and then he would go out and obtain them. Susan Sarandon worked in the university's business office. Jon Voight and Philip Bosco built stage scenery, and Henry Gibson worked as Hartke's chauffeur.\n\nIn October 1981, Hartke was named \"one of the most powerful men in Washington, D.C.\" by the Washingtonian magazine. He had a major impact on Catholic theater, the many souls he touched personally, and the many more who benefitted from the blessings he brought to this world.\n\nToday the theatre at Catholic University bears his name. Also an annual end of the year awards ceremony is named for him: The Gilbie Awards celebrates excellence in CUA theatre. In fact, these Tony-like awards are also shaped in his honor, resembling a robed friar.[2]\n\nHartke and Catholic University were given one of Judy Garland’s dresses from the movie The Wizard of Oz, which they were auctioning for the benefit of their drama school.[3]",

          "Early background": "Hemming was born in Los Angeles on March 1, 1937, one of eleven children. He attended El Monte Union High School in California before joining the United States Marine Corps in 1954.[2]\n\nHemming left the Marines in October 1958 and the following year traveled to Cuba where he aided Fidel Castro and his revolutionary forces.[2]\n\nHemming joined an American effort to overthrow the Batista regime through the efforts of Fidel Castro, but in 1961 he established Interpen as a means to attack and weaken the Castro regime.[citation needed]",
          "Interpen": "Hemming was a leader of Interpen, or Intercontinental Penetration Force, a group of anti-Castro guerrillas who trained at No Name Key in the early 1960s.[citation needed]\n\nDeclassified FBI files show that the agency had an informer within Interpen.[citation needed] His code name was MM T-1. In one document dated June 16, 1961, it said that MM T-1 had \"been connected with Cuban revolutionary activities for the past three years\". One document dated May 12, 1961, claims that Allen Lushane of Miami \"had made a trip to Texas to recruit Americans for some future military action against the Government of Cuba\". The document adds that the \"first training camp was established by Gerald Patrick Hemming with Dick Watley and Ed Colby running the camp.\" In an interview that he gave to John M. Newman on January 6, 1995, Hemming claimed that the FBI informer was Steve Wilson.\n\nThis group of experienced soldiers were involved in training members of the anti-Castro groups funded by the Central Intelligence Agency in Florida in the early 1960s. When the government began to crack down on raids from Florida in 1962, Interpen set up a new training camp in New Orleans, Louisiana.[citation needed] When this work came to an end in 1964 Hemming was employed in the construction industry in Miami.\n\nDuring March and April 1972, while traveling in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, Hemming was able penetrate a conspiracy to assassinate the Chief Executives and Members of Congress of the Republic of Costa Rica, and the Chief Executive of the Republic of Panama.[3]",
          "Hemming and Lee Harvey Oswald": "Hemming claimed that in January 1959 he met Lee Harvey Oswald at the Atsugi Naval Air Station in Japan.[citation needed]\n\nAccording to Victor Marchetti, he was also Lee Harvey Oswald's case officer at then-secret NAF Atsugi.[4]\n\nGerry Hemming has granted long interviews with several writers working on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. These include Anthony Summers (Conspiracy), Noel Twyman (Bloody Treason) and John M. Newman (Oswald and the CIA). Some researchers believe that a combination of Interpen members and anti-Castro Cubans were involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This included Hemming, James Arthur Lewis, Roy Hargraves, Edwin Collins, Steve Wilson, David Sanchez Morales, Herminio Diaz Garcia, Tony Cuesta, Eugenio Martinez, Virgilio Gonzalez, Felipe Vidal Santiago and William \"Rip\" Robertson.",
          "Arms trading": "Gerry Hemming was arrested on August 23, 1976, for the illegal transfer of a silencer and drug smuggling. It seems that this was the point that he began talking about his past work with the CIA. He told one reporter: \"All of a sudden they're accusing me of conspiracy to import marijuana and cocaine. Hey, what about all the other things I've been into for the last 15 years, lets talk about them. Let's talk about the Martin Luther King thing, let's talk about Don Freed, Le Coubre, nigger-killers in bed with the Mafia, the Mafia in bed with the FBI, and the goddamn CIA in bed with all of them. Let's talk about all the people I dirtied up for them over the years.\"",
          "1978 conviction and acquittal": "Hemming was convicted by a Miami jury of conspiracy to import marijuana. In 1978 he was sentenced to six months in prison by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler. Hemming was released on appeal bond and the conviction was later overturned.\n\nIn August, 1978, Victor Marchetti published an article about the assassination of John F. Kennedy in the Liberty Lobby newspaper, The Spotlight. In the article Marchetti argued that the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had obtained a 1966 CIA memo that revealed Hemming, E. Howard Hunt, and Frank Sturgis had been involved in the plot to kill Kennedy. Marchetti's article also included a story that Marita Lorenz had provided information on this plot.\n\nOn April 14, 1980, Hemming was arrested and charged with drug trafficking. He was held on $200,000 bond in Palm Beach County, Florida. He claimed that he had not smuggled Quaaludes, but was establishing his bona fides with drug traffickers so he could penetrate their networks. Hemming told Alan J. Weberman that he was working for Mitchell Werbell III and Lucien Conein. Hemming was sentenced to 35 years in prison with a minimum mandatory sentence of three years but the conviction was later overturned on appeal.\n\nHunt decided to take legal action against the Liberty Lobby. In December, 1981, he was awarded $650,000 in damages. Liberty Lobby appealed to the United States Court of Appeals. It was claimed that Hunt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, had offered a clearly erroneous instruction as to the law of defamation. The three-judge panel agreed and the case was retried. This time Mark Lane defended the Liberty Lobby against Hunt's action.\n\nLane eventually discovered Marchetti's sources. The main source was William R. Corson. It also emerged that Marchetti had also consulted James Angleton and A. J. Weberman before publishing the article. As a result of obtaining depositions from David Atlee Phillips, Richard Helms, G. Gordon Liddy, Stansfield Turner, and Marita Lorenz, plus a skillful cross-examination by Lane of E. Howard Hunt, the jury decided in January, 1985, that Marchetti had not been guilty of libel when he suggested that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated by people working for the CIA. Lane stated that during a later meeting they had, Hemming corroborated the details of the assassination which were outlined during the trial.",
          "Later life": "Hemming became an active member of the JFK assassination research community later in life. He served for a time as official dignitary of the South Florida Research Group.[5] In 1996 he participated in November in Dallas: The JFK-Lancer Conference on assassination research, hosted in Dallas from November 21 to 24. He delivered brief remarks before making himself available for questions from the panelists: Gordon Winslow, Jerry Rose, George Michael Evica, and Charles Drago.[6] This panel became the subject of an article by a journalist who attended the conference.[7]",

          "Early life": "Hootkins was born on July 5, 1948, in Dallas, Texas. He attended St. Mark's School of Texas from grade 1 through 12. At age 15, Hootkins found himself caught up in the FBI's investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy when he was interviewed about Ruth Paine, his Russian teacher. Marina Oswald, the Russian wife of the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, and their children had been living with Paine in Irving. In school he also developed his taste for theatre, joining the same drama group as Tommy Lee Jones, who was a year ahead of him in high school. Hootkins would later say that, since Jones was better-looking and got all the best parts, \"I supported from then on in.\"[1]\n\nHootkins attended Princeton University, studying astrophysics before transferring to oriental studies, where he became fluent in Mandarin Chinese. He was a mainstay of the Theatre Intime, making a particular impact with his performance in Orson Welles' Moby Dick—Rehearsed. On the recommendation of his friend John Lithgow, he moved to London in the early 1970s and trained as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). He made his home in London until 2002, when he moved to Los Angeles.[1]",
          "Stage": "In England, Hootkins found work in the theatre as well as in film, and he would have his greatest success on stage portraying Alfred Hitchcock in Terry Johnson's 2003 hit play Hitchcock Blonde, first at the Royal Court Theatre and in London's West End. The role was such a success that producers planned to take the show to Broadway, but it was canceled after Hootkins was diagnosed with cancer.[1]",
          "Film and television": "Hootkins appeared in many roles that made him a welcome figure at fan conventions, particularly for Star Wars in his role of Porkins, the first X-wing Starfighter pilot to be shot down and destroyed. He also appeared in significant parts in films such as Hardware (1990), Like Father, Like Santa (as Santa Claus), and Hear My Song (1991), where he was the Mr. X who was presumed to be the Irish tenor Josef Locke under a false name.[2] He portrayed Fatty Arbuckle in Ken Russell's infamous 1977 flop Valentino, and played Hans Zarkov's assistant in the 1980 Flash Gordon. He also made appearances in such films as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Tim Burton's Batman (the latter as Lt. Eckhardt).[1]\n\nHe also appeared in several roles on television, including Charles Frohman in The Lost Boys (1978), Colonel Cobb in the remake of The Tomorrow People and as Uncle George in the 2002 remake of The Magnificent Ambersons.\n\nAlthough American, he was a close look-alike to portray the young Winston Churchill through to his premiership in six episodes of the 1981 BBC Cymru Wales biographical series The Life and Times of David Lloyd George. He delivered Churchill's closing eulogy of his friend before parliament to end the series.\n\nAt the time of his death, Hootkins was planning a screenplay on Fatty Arbuckle, focusing on the comic's life after his fall from grace in 1921; he had met Arbuckle's last wife, Addie McPhail.[1]",
          "Voice acting": "Hootkins was also a voice artist, recording dozens of plays for BBC Radio Drama where his roles ranged from J. Edgar Hoover[3] and Orson Welles[4] to Winston Churchill.[citation needed] In audio books, he read works by Jack London, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert Bloch and Carl Hiaasen.[citation needed] He also performed an award-winning, unabridged reading of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick for Naxos Audiobooks that runs for 24 hours and 50 minutes.[5] He voiced Dingodile in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, Maximillian Roivas in the cult hit Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, and Lucifer in the stop-motion film The Miracle Maker. He played Bobby Mallory in BBC Radio 4's dramatisations of Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski novels, alongside Kathleen Turner. He also voiced Lex Luthor in Radio 4's The Adventures of Superman.",
          "Death": "Hootkins died of pancreatic cancer in Santa Monica, California on October 23, 2005, at the age of 57. His mausoleum is at Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery.[6]",

Kennedy. Hosty later testified before the Warren Commission, and came to believe Oswald shot Kennedy in coordination with an agent of the Soviet Union.",
          "Biography": "Hosty was born on August 28, 1924, in Chicago, Illinois.[1] He was one of seven children of Charlotte Irene and James Patrick Hosty Sr., an executive in a sugar company in Chicago. Hosty served in the United States military during World War II from 1942 to 1946 and graduated from the University of Notre Dame.[1]\n\nHosty was assigned by FBI Headquarters to investigate ultra-rightists like members of the KKK and General Edwin Walker along with \"his [Walker's] Minutemen in Dallas.\" Hosty himself said so on page 4 of his book Assignment Oswald (1996).\n\nIn June 1962, Lee Harvey Oswald was allowed to return to the United States after his 1959 defection to the Soviet Union. He brought with him a wife and his infant daughter, both born in the Soviet Union, and FBI agent John Fain was assigned to investigate him. Fain interviewed Oswald twice – once in June 1962 and once in August 1962. After the second interview, Fain along with FBI Headquarters closed the FBI casefile on Oswald. General Edwin Walker was a well-known anti-communist in his day, many US anti-communists were outraged that a defector to the Soviet Union would be allowed to return to the Dallas area with a Russian bride. They demanded that the FBI continually investigate Oswald. Yet the FBI casefile was officially closed.\n\nJames Hosty tried to re-open the FBI casefile on Oswald several times in the next nine months, but FBI Headquarters, including FBI Assistant Director Alan Belmont, rejected those requests. Belmont admitted this in his Warren Commission testimony. Hosty evidently kept a close eye on Oswald, anyway, through 1962 and 1963, without being sanctioned by FBI Headquarters.\n\nIn early November 1963, Hosty made contact with Oswald's wife Marina Oswald in order to interview her about her entry into the United States 17 months previously. Oswald wrote Hosty a hostile note to protest what he considered harassment of Marina. Oswald also had Hosty's name, phone number, and car license plate number in his address book.[2]\n\nHosty failed to tell the Warren Commission the truth about Oswald's hostile letter because he had destroyed it, allegedly on his superior's orders. His superior, Gordon Shanklin, denied this. Because of this, Hosty attracted speculation as a possible conspirator in several conspiracy theories.[3]\n\nThe Warren Commission attorneys often asked how the FBI could either (1) be unaware of the dangers of Lee Harvey Oswald; or (2) be aware of Oswald's danger and yet fail to warn the Secret Service in Washington DC about this threat to JFK in Dallas. J. Edgar Hoover was asked this question numerous times in his own Warren Commission testimony, with ambiguous replies (which fed different JFK conspiracy theories). After those hearings, Hoover transferred Hosty to the FBI's slow-paced Kansas City office until his mandatory retirement in 1979.\n\nHosty later wrote a memoir about the Kennedy assassination, titled Assignment: Oswald. In this book, Hosty claimed to have stumbled upon secret CIA information proving that Oswald killed JFK in collusion with Soviet consul Valery Kostikov. Hosty further claimed that J. Edgar Hoover and all of FBI Headquarters had deliberately prevented Hosty from learning the truth about Kostikov. Hosty, without any official confirmation, alleged that Kostikov was “the KGB's chief assassination expert for the Western hemisphere” (Hosty, 1996, p. 215).\n\nSince Oswald had admittedly met \"Kostin\" in Mexico City during the final week of September, 1963, Hosty concluded that the Soviets killed JFK with the aid of Lee Harvey Oswald. In this way, Hosty himself fostered a popular JFK conspiracy theory. It is noteworthy that Hosty's conspiracy theory was basically the same as that posed by General Walker, i.e. a 'Communist Conspiracy.' Hosty's intrigue about Kostikov runs like a thread from the start to the finish of his 1996 book (Hosty, 1996, Index 'V.V. Kostikov').\n\nHosty received an unsigned note from Lee Harvey Oswald about two weeks before the Kennedy assassination. The note asked Hosty to stop questioning Oswald's wife. Hosty filed it away. He first met Oswald on November 22, 1963. It was while he was interrogating Oswald on November 22 that he realized that the unsigned note he had received two weeks prior was from Oswald. He said that, on orders from his supervisor, he destroyed the note after Oswald was killed on November 24, 1963.[1] Notes taken down by Hosty during his interrogation of Oswald on November 22, indicate that when Oswald was asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, he claimed to have \"went outside to watch P. Parade\" (referring to the presidential motorcade).[4] The newly discovered Hosty interrogation notes, unearthed at NARA by former British Intelligence agent and JFK researcher, Malcolm Blunt, were recently featured for the first time in the 2020 NHK World-Japan documentary Oswald and JFK - Unsolved Cases, Part II: The Chessmaster (at 35:00 - 36:10).\n\nHosty retired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1979.[1]\n\nHe died of prostate cancer on June 10, 2011, in Kansas City, Missouri.[1]",
          "Portrayal in fiction": "Hosty was portrayed in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK as having a central role in a government conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and frame Oswald.[1] In the 2011 Stephen King novel 11/22/63, Hosty questions the protagonist Jake Epping, a time traveler who has just narrowly prevented Oswald from killing the president.[5] Hosty is suspicious of Epping because of what he knows about Oswald and his investigation by the FBI, but assists Epping in his efforts to quietly disappear, so that he may return to 2011. The television adaptation has Epping returning to 2016, and Gil Bellows briefly appears as Hosty.\n\nActor Ron Livingston portrays Hosty in writer and director Peter Landesman's 2013 film Parkland, which recounts the subsequent events that occurred at Dallas' Parkland Hospital on the day JFK was assassinated.[6][better source needed]\n\n^\na b c d e f g h Vitello, Paul (June 19, 2011). \"James P.

          "Lead": "Sarah Tilghman Hughes (born Sarah Augusta Tilghman; August 2, 1896 – April 23, 1985) was an American lawyer and federal judge who served on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. She is best known as the judge who swore in Lyndon B. Johnson as President of the United States on Air Force One after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. She is the first woman to have sworn in a US President. The photo depicting Hughes administering the oath of office to Johnson is widely viewed as the most famous photo ever taken aboard Air Force One.[1][2]",
          "Early life, family and education": "Born Sarah Augusta Tilghman in Baltimore, Maryland, she was the daughter of Elizabeth (née Haughton) and James Cooke Tilghman. She went to high school at Western Female High School (now Western High School) in Baltimore, where she was elected president of the freshman class. Standing only five feet one-half inch at maturity, she was described by a classmate as \"small but terrible\".[3] Her determined personality extended to the athletic field where she participated in intramural track and field, gymnastics, and basketball. Her strong personal discipline was seen in her habit of going to bed by 8 pm and getting up at 4 am, a habit she continued through much of her life. After graduating from Western High School, she attended Goucher College, an all-women's college in central Baltimore near home. She participated in athletics at Goucher. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1917.\n\nTwo years later, she moved to Washington, D.C. and attended The George Washington University Law School classes at night. She graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1922.",
          "Career": "After college, Hughes taught science at Salem Academy in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for two years. In 1919 she moved to Washington, D.C., and attended The George Washington University Law School classes at night and during the day worked as a police officer. As a police officer, Hughes did not carry a gun or wear a police uniform because she worked to prevent crimes among women and girls, patrolling areas where female runaways and prostitutes were normally found. Her job was an expression of the progressive idea of rehabilitation instead of punishment. Hughes later credited this job with instilling in her a sense of commitment and responsibility to women and children. At that time she lived in a tent home near the Potomac River and commuted to the campus by canoe each evening.[3]\n\nIn 1922, she moved to Dallas, Texas, with her husband George Ernest Hughes, whom she had met at law school. He quickly found employment, but Sarah faced significant obstacles as a woman during a time in which law firms generally did not regard women as qualified.[4] Eventually, Priest, Herndon, and Ledbetter, a small law firm, gave her a rent-free space and even referred some cases to her in exchange for her services as a receptionist.\n\nAs her practice grew, she became increasingly active in local women's organizations. She joined the Zonta Club, the Business and Professional Women's Club, the Dallas Women's Political League, the League of Women Voters, YWCA, Dallas College Club, and the American Association of University Women. Hughes served as Chair of the AAUW Committee on the Economic and Legal Status of Women, advocating equal pay jury service for women, and improved status and recognition for women in the Armed Services.\n\nShe practiced law for eight years in Dallas before becoming involved in politics, first being elected in 1930 to three terms in the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat.[5] In 1935, Hughes accepted an appointment as a state judge from Governor James Burr V Allred for the Fourteenth District Court in Dallas, becoming the state's first female district judge. In 1936, she was elected to the same post. She was re-elected six more times and remained in that post until 1961.",
          "Federal judicial service": "Hughes received a recess appointment from President John F. Kennedy on October 5, 1961, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. She was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1962. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 16, 1962, and received her commission on March 17, 1962. She was the only female judge appointed by President Kennedy, the first female federal judge in Texas and the third female to serve in the federal judiciary. She assumed senior status on August 4, 1975. Her service terminated on April 23, 1985, due to her death.[6]",
          "Circumstances of appointment": "The appointment almost did not happen, according to the historian Robert Caro, because the Kennedy administration thought that Hughes was \"too old\" and they were seeking younger jurists for the lifetime tenure afforded under Article III for federal judgeships. Hughes had been a \"longtime Johnson ally\", and as vice president, Johnson had asked Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general of the United States and brother of President John F. Kennedy, \"to nominate Mrs. Hughes\" for the Federal bench, but the United States Justice Department turned him down. Johnson then offered the job to another attorney. However, Hughes was also an ally of the speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, who held up a bill important to Robert Kennedy until Hughes' appointment was announced.[7] Johnson was outraged at the chain of events because it appeared to be an intentional attempt to insult him, and made him look like the \"biggest liar and fool in the history of the State of Texas\". President Kennedy's White House appointments secretary called it a \"terrible mistake\", citing negligence on the part of Kennedy's staff. The story of how Hughes received her appointment made the rounds of Washington, D.C., insiders, including the political gossip columnists Evans and Novak, which hurt Johnson's reputation for political effectiveness.[7] Historian Steven Gillon agrees with Caro's story, although it was not cross-cited.[8]",
          "Women on juries": "Hughes was concerned over the ineligibility of women in Texas to serve on juries even though they had the right to vote. She and Helen Edmunds Moore coauthored[when?] a proposed amendment that would allow women on juries in Texas, but the bill failed and went nowhere. Despite defeat, Hughes became closely identified with this cause and few people were recognized as working harder for this right. Due in to part to Hughes's work, Texas women secured the right to serve on juries in 1954.[9][10]",
          "Administering the oath of office": "Two years into her tenure as a federal district judge, on November 22, 1963, Hughes was called upon to administer the oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson after the assassination of President Kennedy, a task usually performed by the Chief Justice of the United States. According to an interview with Barefoot Sanders, who was United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas at the time:[11]\n\nLBJ called Irving Goldberg from the plane and asked, 'Who can swear me in?' Goldberg called me, and I said, 'Well, we know a federal judge can.' Then I got a call from the President's plane, with the command 'Find Sarah Hughes.' Coincidentally, Judge Hughes, Jan [Sanders' wife] and I [Sanders] were supposed to go to Austin that night for a dinner for President Kennedy. I reached her at home and said, 'They need you to swear in the Vice President at Love Field. Please get out there.'\n\nShe said, 'Is there an oath?'\n\nI said, 'Yes, but we haven't found it yet.'\n\nShe said, 'Don't worry about it; I'll make one up.'\n\nShe was very resourceful, you know. By the time she got to the airplane, someone had already called it into the plane. We quickly realized that it is in the Constitution [Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 8].\n\nHughes believed that President Johnson chose her to administer the oath of office due to their friendship,[citation needed] and because Johnson was not pleased with other federal judges in Dallas.[citation needed] Because of this, Hughes was the most suitable choice. Sanders and Hughes no doubt believed those rationales, but Johnson had other reasons to choose her, according to Caro: \"He knew who he wanted - and she was in Dallas\". Citing another historian, Max Holland,[12] Caro noted that the circumstances surrounding Hughes's appointment meant that she \"'personified Johnson's utter powerlessness'\" when he was vice president. The new president ordered his staff, \"'Get Sarah Hughes ... Find her.'\" Hughes was found and driven to Love Field, while Air Force One—and thus the inauguration of the new president—was held up just for her. Caro asserts that Johnson, in his insecurities, chose Hughes to show to the world that he was now powerful.[13] Two other historians (Holland and Gillen) agree with Caro's assessment that Johnson was still upset that he'd not been consulted on Hughes's appointment in the first place, so it was a way to placate his ego.[8][12] On the other hand, Johnson needed to make sure that \"the swearing-in take place at the earliest possible moment ... to demonstrate, quickly, continuity and stability to the nation and the world. ... \" Johnson used the \"few minutes to spare\" while waiting for Hughes to arrive to plead to Kennedy's staffers to stay awhile for the transition. Finally, she arrived, along with the media and Jackie Kennedy; only then the swearing-in could take place. Hughes noted that Jackie's \"eyes 'were cast down'\" when Johnson nodded to the judge to start the oath of office.[14]",
          "Other significant contributions": "Hughes was involved in multiple court decisions, including Roe v. Wade, Shultz v. Brookhaven General Hospital, and Taylor v. Sterrett. Hughes was a member of the three-judge panel that first heard the case of Roe v. Wade; the panel's decision was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. In Taylor v. Sterrett, she argued to upgrade prisoner treatment in the Dallas County jail. Hughes noted that \"the Dallas County Jail was very much in need of change. It was in deplorable condition, and [she] think[s], that under [her] jurisdiction, it became one of the best jails in the whole United States\".[15]",
          "Later years": "She retired from the active federal bench in 1975, though she continued to work as a judge with senior status until 1982. A close friend of Lyndon Johnson and his family, Hughes participated in his inauguration in 1965, took part in the book signing of Lady Bird Johnson's White House memoirs, and participated in the dedication of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.",
          "Legacy": "The Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Hughes' alma mater, Goucher College, was founded in the 1950s with a grant from the Maurice and Laura Falk Foundation.[16] The special collections reading room of the University of North Texas Libraries is also named in her honor.[17]\n\nThe dress Hughes wore when swearing in Lyndon Johnson on Air Force One was donated to a wax museum in Grand Prairie, Texas, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1988.[18]",
          "Personal life and death": "At law school, she met George Ernest Hughes, and they married March 13, 1922, the same year she received her law degree. Hughes and her husband were Episcopalians. They had no children. George died on June 1, 1964.[19]\n\nIn 1982, Hughes suffered a debilitating stroke which confined her to a nursing home in Dallas. She died three years later on April 23, 1985.[20]",

From 1949 to 1970, Hunt served as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where he was a central figure in U.S. regime change in Latin America including the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état and the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba. Along with G. Gordon Liddy, Frank Sturgis, and others, Hunt was one of the Nixon administration's so-called White House Plumbers, a team of operatives charged with identifying government leaks to outside parties.\n\nHunt and Liddy plotted the Watergate burglaries and other clandestine operations for the Nixon administration. In the Watergate scandal, Hunt was convicted of burglary, conspiracy, and wiretapping, and was sentenced to 33 months in prison. After his release, Hunt lived in Mexico and then Miami until his death in January 2007.",
          "Early life and education": "Hunt was born in Hamburg, New York,[1] the son of Ethel Jean (Totterdale) and Everette Howard Hunt Sr., an attorney and Republican Party official.\n\nHe attended Hamburg High School in Hamburg, where he graduated in 1936 along with fellow classmate Howard J. Osborn.[2][3] He then attended Brown University, an Ivy League university in Providence, Rhode Island, where he graduated in 1940.",
          "U.S. military and OSS": "During World War II, Hunt served in the U.S. Navy on the destroyer USS Mayo and the U.S. Army Air Corps. He also served in China with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency.[4]",
          "Author": "Hunt was a prolific author, publishing 73 books during his lifetime.[5] During and after World War II, he wrote several novels under his own name, including East of Farewell (1942), Limit of Darkness (1944), Stranger in Town (1947), Maelstrom (1949) Bimini Run (1949), and The Violent Ones (1950). He also wrote spy and hardboiled novels under an array of pseudonyms, including Robert Dietrich, Gordon Davis, David St. John, and P. S. Donoghue.\n\nSome parallels exist between Hunt's writings and his experiences during the Watergate scandal and espionage.[6] He continued his writing career after he was released from prison, publishing nearly twenty spy thrillers between 1980 and 2000.[1][7]\n\nIn 1946, Hunt was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for his writing.",
          "Economic Cooperation Administration": "Prior to 1949, Hunt served as an officer in the Information Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, a predecessor of the Mutual Security Agency.[8]",
          "Central Intelligence Agency": "Shortly following the end of World War II, the OSS was disbanded. In 1947, with the Cold War emerging and intensifying, the absence of a central intelligence organization was seen as a national security deficiency, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was formed. In October 1949, just as Warner Bros. acquired the rights to Hunt's novel Bimini Run, Hunt joined the CIA's Office of Policy Coordination (OPC). He was assigned as a covert action officer specializing in political action and influence in what later came to be the CIA's Special Activities Center.[9]\n\nIn 1950, Hunt was appointed OPC Station Chief in Mexico City, where he recruited and supervised William F. Buckley Jr., who worked under Hunt[10] in his OPC Station in Mexico from 1951 to 1952. Buckley and Hunt remained lifelong friends, and Buckley became godfather to Hunt's first three children.[11]\n\nIn Mexico, Hunt helped lay the framework for Operation PBFortune, later renamed Operation PBSuccess, the successful covert operation to overthrow Jacobo Árbenz, the democratically elected president of Guatemala. Hunt would later say, \"What we wanted to do was to have a terror campaign, to terrify Arbenz particularly, to terrify his troops, much as the German Stuka bombers terrified the population of Holland, Belgium and Poland.\"[12][13]\n\nHunt was then assigned as Chief of Covert Action in Japan, and later as Chief of Station in Uruguay, where he was noted by American diplomatic contemporary Samuel F. Hart for controversial working methods.[1]\n\nHunt was subsequently assigned responsibility for organizing Cuban exile leaders in the United States into a suitably representative government-in-exile that would, after the Bay of Pigs Invasion, form a pro-American government that could replace Fidel Castro.[14]\n\nPlanning for the Bay of Pigs invasion began during the Eisenhower administration, but Hunt was later bitter about what he perceived as President John F. Kennedy's lack of commitment to the operation, which was designed to attack and overthrow the Castro government.[15] In his semi-fictional autobiography, Give Us This Day, Hunt wrote, \"The Kennedy administration yielded Castro all the excuse he needed to gain a tighter grip on the island of José Martí, then moved shamefacedly into the shadows and hoped the Cuban issue would simply melt away.\"\n\nIn 1959, Hunt helped CIA Director Allen W. Dulles write The Craft of Intelligence.[16] The following year, in 1960, Hunt established Brigade 2506, a CIA-sponsored group of Cuban exiles formed to attempt the military overthrow of the Castro's government in Cuba. The Bay of Pigs invasion commenced on April 17, 1961, but was quickly aborted and viewed as a fiasco. Hunt was then reassigned as executive assistant to Dulles.[17] In 1961, President Kennedy fired Dulles for the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.\n\nHunt then served from 1962 to 1964 as the first Chief of Covert Action for the CIA's Domestic Operations Division (DODS).\n\nIn 1974, Hunt told The New York Times that he worked for DODS for approximately four years, beginning in 1962, shortly after the agency's establishment by the Kennedy administration over the objection of Richard Helms and Thomas H. Karamessines. Hunt said that the division was assembled shortly after the Bay of Pigs operation, and that \"many men connected with that failure were shunted into the new domestic unit.\" He said that some of his projects from 1962 to 1966 dealt largely with subsidizing and manipulating news and publishing organizations in the United States, which he said \"did seem to violate the intent of the agency's charter.\"[18]\n\nIn 1964, John A. McCone, then deputy chief of intelligence at the CIA, directed Hunt to take a special assignment as a Non-official cover officer in Madrid, Spain, tasked with creating an American answer to Ian Fleming's British MI-6 James Bond novel series. While in Spain, Hunt was covered as a recently retired U.S. State Department Foreign Service Officer who moved his family to Spain in order to write the first installment of the nine-novel Peter Ward series, On Hazardous Duty, published in 1965.\n\nAfter a year and a half in Spain, Hunt returned to his assignment at DODS. Following a brief tenure on the Special Activities Staff of the Western European Division, he became Chief of Covert Action for the region in July 1968, and was based in the Washington metropolitan area. Hunt was lauded for his \"sagacity, balance and imagination\", and received the second-highest rating of Strong signifying \"performance ... characterized by exceptional proficiency\" in a performance review from the Division's Chief of Operations in April 1969. However, this was downgraded to the third-highest rating of \"Adequate\" in an amended review from the Division's Deputy Chief, who recognized Hunt's \"broad experience\" but opined that \"a series of personal and taxing problems\" had \"tended to dull his cutting edge.\"[19]\n\nHunt later said that he \"had been stigmatized by the Bay of Pigs\", and had come to terms with the fact that he \"would not get promoted too much higher.\"[20]\n\nIn his final years with the CIA, Hunt began to cultivate new contacts in society and the business world.[20] While serving as vice president of Brown University's club in Washington, D.C., he befriended and commenced a strong association with the organization's president, former congressional aide Charles Colson, who was working on Richard Nixon's presidential campaign.[21]",
          "CIA retirement": "Hunt retired from the CIA at the pay grade of GS-15, Step 8[22] on April 30, 1970.\n\nAfter retiring from the CIA, Hunt neglected to elect survivorship benefits for his wife. In April 1971, he requested to retroactively amend his election but was rebuffed by the agency. In a May 5, 1972, letter to CIA General Counsel Lawrence Houston, Hunt raised the possibility of returning to active duty for a short period of time in exchange for activating the benefits upon his proposed second retirement. Houston advised Hunt in his May 16, 1972, response that this \"would be in violation of the spirit of the CIA Retirement Act\".[22]",
          "Robert R. Mullen Company": "Immediately following his retirement, Hunt went to work for the Robert R. Mullen Company, which cooperated with the CIA; H. R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff to President Nixon, wrote in 1978 that the Mullen Company was in fact a CIA front company, a fact that was apparently unknown to Haldeman while he worked in the White House.[23] Through CIA's Project QKENCHANT, Hunt obtained a Covert Security Approval to handle the firm's affairs during Mullen's absence from Washington.[24][25]",
          "White House": "Richard Nixon Alexander Butterfield Charles Colson John Dean John Ehrlichman Gerald Ford H. R. Haldeman E. Howard Hunt Egil Krogh G. Gordon Liddy Gordon C. Strachan Rose Mary Woods\n\nRichard Nixon\n\nAlexander Butterfield\n\nCharles Colson\n\nJohn Dean\n\nJohn Ehrlichman\n\nGerald Ford\n\nH. R. Haldeman\n\nE. Howard Hunt\n\nEgil Krogh\n\nG. Gordon Liddy\n\nGordon C. Strachan\n\nRose Mary Woods\n\nvte\n\nv\n\nt\n\ne\n\nIn 1971, Colson, who was then director of Nixon's Office of Public Liaison, hired Hunt, where he joined the White House Special Investigations Unit, specializing in political sabotage.[4]\n\nHunt's first assignment for the White House was a covert operation to break into the Los Angeles office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, Lewis J. Fielding.[26] In July 1971, Fielding refused a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for psychiatric data on Ellsberg.[27] Hunt and Liddy cased the building in late August.[28] The burglary, on September 3, 1971, was not detected, but no Ellsberg files were found.[29]\n\nIn the summer of 1971, Colson authorized Hunt to travel to New England to seek potentially scandalous information on Senator Edward Kennedy related to Chappaquiddick incident and Kennedy's possible extramarital affairs.[23] Hunt sought and used CIA disguises and other equipment for the project.[30] The mission eventually proved unsuccessful, with little useful information uncovered by Hunt.[23]\n\nHunt's White House duties included assassinations-related disinformation. In September 1971, Hunt forged top-secret U.S. State Department cables designed to prove that President Kennedy had personally and specifically ordered the assassination of South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, during the 1963 South Vietnamese coup. He offered the forged documents to a Life magazine reporter.[31] Hunt later told the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973 that he fabricated the cables to show a link between President Kennedy and the assassination of Diem, a Catholic, to estrange Catholic voters from the Democratic Party, after Colson suggested he \"might be able to improve upon the record.\"[32]\n\nIn 1972, on Colson's orders, Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy were part of an assassination plot targeting journalist Jack Anderson.[33] Nixon disliked Anderson because Anderson published a 1960 election-eve story about a secret loan from Howard Hughes to Nixon's brother,[34] which Nixon believed was a factor in his election defeat to John F. Kennedy. Hunt and Liddy met with a CIA operative and discussed methods of assassinating Anderson, which included covering Anderson's car steering wheel with LSD to drug him and cause a fatal accident,[4] poisoning his aspirin bottle, and staging a fatal robbery. The assassination plot never materialized because Hunt and Liddy were arrested for their involvement in the Watergate scandal later that year.\n\nSeymour Hersh reported in The New Yorker that the Nixon White House tapes show that, following the assassination attempt on George Wallace on May 15, 1972, Nixon and Colson agreed to send Hunt to the Milwaukee home of the gunman, Arthur Bremer, to place McGovern presidential campaign material there. The intention was to link Bremer with the Democrats. Hersh wrote that, in a taped conversation:\n\nNixon is energized and excited by what seems to be the ultimate political dirty trick: the FBI and the Milwaukee police will be convinced, and will tell the world, that the attempted assassination of Wallace had its roots in left-wing Democratic politics.\n\nHunt did not make the trip, however, because the FBI moved quickly to seal Bremer's apartment and place it under police guard.[35]\n\nIn his memoir Hunt reports that the day after the assassination attempt he received a call from Chuck Colson, asking him to break into Bremer's apartment and plant \"leftist literature to connect him to the Democrats\". Hunt recalls that he was highly sceptical of the plan due to the apartment being guarded by the FBI but investigated the feasibility of it anyway due to Colson's insistence.[36]\n\nLater that year, Hunt organized the bugging of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex office building.[37] On June 18, 1972, five burglars were arrested by police at the Watergate. Hunt and Liddy were indicted on federal charges three months later.\n\nHunt put pressure on the White House and the Committee for the Re-Election of the President for cash payments to cover legal fees, family support, and expenses, for himself and his fellow burglars. Key Nixon figures, including Haldeman, Charles Colson, Herbert W. Kalmbach, John Mitchell, Fred LaRue, and John Dean eventually became entangled in the payoff schemes. Large sums of money were passed to Hunt and his accomplices in an attempt to secure their silence at the trial, by pleading guilty to avoid prosecutors' questions, and afterwards.[38]\n\nThe Washington Post and The New York Times later reported on the payoff scheme, publishing many articles that proved to be the beginning of the end for the cover-up since prosecutors felt obligated to follow up on the media reports. Hunt also pressured Colson, Dean, and John Ehrlichman to ask Nixon for clemency in sentencing, and eventual presidential pardons for himself and his Watergate break-in partners, which eventually helped implicate and snare those higher up.[39]\n\nHunt was sentenced to 30 months to eight years in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal,[40] and spent 33 months in prison at Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood and the low-security Federal Prison Camp at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on a conspiracy charge; he arrived at the Eglin Air Force Base prison on April 25, 1975.[41] While at Allenwood, Hunt suffered a mild stroke.[42]",
          "JFK conspiracy allegations": "Hunt supported the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[43]",
          "Three tramps": "Shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, The Dallas Morning News, the Dallas Times Herald, and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram photographed three transients under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository.[44] The men were later known as the three tramps.[45]\n\nAccording to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that these men were involved in a conspiracy originated from theorist Richard E. Sprague who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to Jim Garrison during his investigation of Clay Shaw.[45] Appearing before a nationwide audience on the December 31, 1968, episode of The Tonight Show, Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination.[45]\n\nSeveral years later, in 1974, assassination researchers Alan J. Weberman and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were Hunt and fellow Watergate conspirator Frank Sturgis.[46] In 1975, comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield.[46] Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage, including in Rolling Stone and Newsweek.[46][47]\n\nIn 1975, the U.S. President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, also known as the Rockefeller Commission, investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the CIA, participated in Kennedy's assassination.[48] The commission's final report stated that witnesses testified that the derelicts bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis \"were not shown to have any qualifications in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman\".[49] Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, \"a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis\" with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men was Hunt or Sturgis.[50]\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the tramps with those of Hunt and Sturgis and also with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Chrisman.[51] According to the committee, only Chrisman resembled any of the tramps, but determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of Kennedy's assassination.[51]\n\nIn 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963, arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney.[52] According to the arrest reports, the three men were \"taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot\", detained as \"investigative prisoners\", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.[52]",
          "Compulsive Spy": "In 1973, Viking Press published Compulsive Spy, a book about Hunt's career, by Tad Szulc, a former correspondent for The New York Times.[53] Szulc wrote that unnamed CIA sources told him that Hunt, working with Rolando Cubela Secades, had a role in coordinating the assassination of Castro during an aborted second invasion of Cuba after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.[53] Szulc wrote that Hunt was the acting chief of the CIA station in Mexico City in 1963 while Lee Harvey Oswald was also in Mexico City.[54][55][nb 1]\n\nIn June 1975, the Rockefeller Commission investigated allegations that the CIA, including Hunt, may have had contact with Oswald or Jack Ruby,[57] concluding that one \"witness testified that E. Howard Hunt was Acting Chief of a CIA Station in Mexico City in 1963, implying that he could have had contact with Oswald when Oswald visited Mexico City in September 1963.\"[58] The report concluded, however, that there was \"no credible evidence\" of CIA involvement in the assassination, reporting that, \"At no time was [Hunt] ever the Chief, or Acting Chief, of a CIA Station in Mexico City.[58]\n\nReleased in the Fall of 1975 after the Rockefeller Commission's report, Weberman and Canfield's book Coup d'Etat in America reiterated Szulc's allegation.[55][nb 2]\n\nIn July 1976, Hunt filed a $2.5 million libel suit against the authors and the book's publishers and editor.[59] According to Ellis Rubin, Hunt's attorney who filed the suit in a Miami federal court, the book said that Hunt took part in the assassination of Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[59]\n\nAs part of his suit, Hunt filed a legal action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in September 1978 requesting that Szulc be cited for contempt if he refused to divulge his sources.[54] Three months earlier, Szulc stated in a deposition that he refused to name his sources due to \"the professional confidentiality of sources\" and \"journalistic privilege\".[54] Rubin said that knowing the source of the allegation that Hunt was in Mexico City in 1963 was important because Szulc's passage \"is what everybody uses as an authority ... he's cited in everything written on E. Howard Hunt\".[54] He added that rumors that Hunt was involved in the Kennedy assassination might be put to end if Szulc's source was revealed.[54] Stating that Hunt had not provided a sufficient reason to override Szulc's First Amendment rights to protect the confidentiality of his sources, Albert Vickers Bryan Jr., the U.S. District Court judge, ruled in favor of Szulc.[55]",
          "Libel suit: Liberty Lobby and The Spotlight": "On November 3, 1978, Hunt gave a security-classified deposition for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). He denied knowledge of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy. The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) released the deposition in February 1996.[60] Two newspaper articles published a few months before the deposition stated that a 1966 CIA memo linking Hunt to the assassination of President Kennedy had recently been provided to the HSCA. The first article, by Victor Marchetti – author of the book The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence (1974) – appeared in the Liberty Lobby newspaper The Spotlight on August 14, 1978.\n\nAccording to Marchetti, the memo said in essence, \"Some day we will have to explain Hunt's presence in Dallas on November 22, 1963.\"[61] He also wrote that Hunt, Frank Sturgis and Gerry Patrick Hemming would soon be implicated in a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe second article, by Joseph J. Trento and Jacquie Powers, appeared six days later in the Sunday edition of The News Journal, Wilmington, Delaware.[62] It alleged that the purported memo was initialed by Richard Helms and James Angleton and showed that, shortly after Helms and Angleton were elevated to their highest positions in the CIA, they discussed the fact that Hunt had been in Dallas on the day of the Kennedy assassination and that his presence there had to be kept secret. However, nobody has been able to produce this supposed memo, and the United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States determined that Hunt had been in Washington, D.C., on the day of the assassination.[63]\n\nHunt sued Liberty Lobby – but not the Sunday News Journal – for libel. Liberty Lobby stipulated, in this first trial, that the question of Hunt's alleged involvement in the assassination would not be contested.[64] Hunt prevailed and was awarded $650,000 damages. In 1983, however, the case was overturned on appeal because of error in jury instructions.[65]\n\nIn a second trial, held in 1985, Mark Lane made an issue of Hunt's location on the day of the Kennedy assassination.[66] Lane successfully defended Liberty Lobby by producing evidence suggesting that Hunt had been in Dallas. He used depositions from David Atlee Phillips, Richard Helms, Liddy, Stansfield Turner and Marita Lorenz, plus a cross-examination of Hunt. On retrial, the jury rendered a verdict for Liberty Lobby.[67]\n\nLane claimed he convinced the jury that Hunt was a JFK assassination conspirator, but some of the jurors who were interviewed by the media said they disregarded the conspiracy theory and judged the case (according to the judge's jury instructions) on whether the article was published with \"reckless disregard for the truth.\"[68] Lane outlined his theory about Hunt's and the CIA's role in Kennedy's murder in a 1991 book, Plausible Denial.[69]",
          "Mitrokhin Archive": "Former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin indicated in 1999 that Hunt was made part of a fabricated conspiracy theory disseminated by a Soviet \"active measures\" program designed to discredit the CIA and the United States.[70][71] According to Mitrokhin, the KGB created a forged letter from Oswald to Hunt implying that the two were linked as conspirators, then forwarded copies of it to \"three of the most active conspiracy buffs\" in 1975.[70] Mitrokhin indicated that the photocopies were accompanied by a fake cover letter from an anonymous source alleging that the original had been given to FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley and was apparently being suppressed.[70]",
          "Kerry Thornley's memoir": "According to Kerry Thornley, who served with Oswald in the Marine Corps and wrote the biographical book The Idle Warriors about him before the assassination of the president (the manuscript was seized during the investigation and was kept as physical evidence for a long time).[72]\n\nThornley met regularly met with a man in New Orleans known to him as Gary Kirstein, with whom they discussed the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Also, according to Thornley, Kirstein in those years wanted to organize the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and planned to \"frame a jailbird for it.\"[73] In \"Confession to Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK by Kerry Thornley as told to Sondra London\" he said that after Watergate, when photos of Howard Hunt appeared in the media, he found that he was very similar to his acquaintance Kirstein, along with whom they discussed organizing the assassination of the president.[74]",
          "Deathbed confession of involvement in Kennedy assassination": "After Hunt's death, Howard St. John Hunt and David Hunt stated that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.[4][75] Notes and audio recordings were made.\n\nIn the April 5, 2007, issue of Rolling Stone, St. John Hunt detailed a number of individuals purported to be implicated by his father, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Atlee Phillips, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, Antonio Veciana, William Harvey, and an assassin he termed \"French gunman grassy knoll\" who many presume is Lucien Sarti.[4][76] The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs to avoid possible perjury charges.[75] According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain and furthermore falsified accounts of Hunt's supposed confession.[75] The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \"inconclusive\".[75]",
          "Memoir: American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate, and Beyond": "Hunt's memoir, American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate, and Beyond,[77] was ghost-written by Greg Aunapu and published by John Wiley & Sons in March 2007.[78]\n\nAccording to the Hunt Literary Estate, Hunt had intended to write an update to his 1974 autobiography Undercover and supplement this edition with post-9/11 reflections, but by the time he had embarked on the project, he was too ill to continue. This prompted John Wiley & Sons to search for and hire a ghost writer to write the book in its entirety. According to St. John Hunt, it was he who suggested to his father the idea of a memoir to reveal what he knew about the Kennedy assassination, but the Hunt Literary Estate disputes this as scurrilous.[75]\n\nThe foreword to American Spy was written by William F. Buckley Jr.[79] According to Buckley, he was asked through an intermediary to write the introduction but declined after he found that the manuscript contained material \"that suggested transgressions of the highest order, including a hint that LBJ might have had a hand in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy.\"[79] He stated that the work \"was clearly ghostwritten\", and eventually agreed to write an introduction focusing on his early friendship with Hunt after he received a revised manuscript \"with the loony grassy-knoll bits chiseled out\".[79]\n\nPublishers Weekly called American Spy a \"breezy, unrepentant memoir\" and described it as a \"nostalgic memoir [that] breaks scant new ground in an already crowded field\".[80] Tim Rutten of the Los Angeles Times said it was \"a bitter and self-pitying memoir\" and \"offers a rather standard account of how men of his generation became involved in intelligence work\".[81]\n\nReferencing the book's title, Tim Weiner of The New York Times wrote: \"American Spy is presented as a 'secret history,' a double-barreled misrepresentation. There are no real secrets in this book. As history it is bunk.\"[82] Weiner said that the author's examination of the Kennedy assassination was the low-point of the book, indicating that Hunt pretended to take various conspiracy theories, including the involvement of former President Johnson, seriously.[82] He concluded his review describing it as a work \"in a long tradition of arrant nonsense\" and \"a book to shun\".[82] Joseph C. Goulden of The Washington Times described it as a \"true mess of a book\" and dismissed Hunt's allegations against Johnson as \"fantasy\".[83] Goulden summarized his review: \"I wish now that I had not read this pathetic book. Avoid it.\"[83]\n\nWriting for The Christian Science Monitor, Daniel Schorr said \"Hunt tells most of his Watergate venture fairly straight\".[84] Contrasting this opinion, Politico's James Rosen described the chapters regarding Watergate as the \"[m]ost problematic\" and wrote: \"There are numerous factual errors – misspelled names, wrong dates, phantom participants in meetings, fictitious orders given – and the authors never substantively address, only pause occasionally to demean, the vast scholarly literature that has arisen in the last two decades to explain the central mystery of Watergate.\"[85]\n\nRosen's review was not entirely negative and he indicated that the book \"succeeds in taking readers beyond the caricatures and conspiracy theories to preserve the valuable memory of Hunt as he really was: passionate patriot; committed Cold Warrior; a lover of fine food, wine and women; incurable intriguer, wicked wit and superb storyteller.\"[85] Dennis Lythgoe of Deseret News said \"[t]he writing style is awkward and often embarrassing\", but that \"the book as a whole is a fascinating look into the mind of one of the major Watergate figures\".[86] In National Review, Mark Riebling praised American Spy as \"the only autobiography I know of that convincingly conveys what it was like to be an American spy.\"[87]\n\nThe Boston Globe writer Martin Nolan called it \"admirable and important\" and said that Hunt \"presents a livelier, tabloid version of the 1970s\".[88] According to Nolan: \"It is the best moment-by-moment depiction of the June 17, 1972, burglary of Democratic National Committee headquarters I have ever read.\"[88]\n\nCanadian journalist David Giammarco interviewed Hunt for the December 2000 issue of Cigar Aficionado magazine.[89] Hunt later wrote the foreword to Giammarco's book For Your Eyes Only: Behind the Scenes of the James Bond Films (ECW Press, 2002).\n\nHunt was portrayed by Ed Harris in the 1995 biopic Nixon. In the 2019 film The Irishman, Hunt is portrayed by stage actor Daniel Jenkins. In the 2022 series Gaslit, Hunt is portrayed by J. C. MacKenzie.[90] In the 2023 HBO miniseries White House Plumbers, Hunt is played by Woody Harrelson.[91]\n\nA fictionalized account of Hunt's role in the Bay of Pigs operation appears in Norman Mailer's 1991 novel Harlot's Ghost.\n\nOn the television series The X-Files, the antagonist known as Cigarette Smoking Man (portrayed by William B. Davis) was a shadowy intelligence operative partly modeled on Hunt.[92] The episode \"Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man\", fleshed out the character's backstory as unsuccessful author of mystery/suspense fiction in his spare time. When meeting Lee Harvey Oswald, prior to the JFK assassination, he goes by the alias 'Mr. Hunt.'[93]",
          "Marriage to Dorothy Wetzel": "Hunt's first wife, Dorothy Louise (née Wetzel) Day Goutiere, was born on April 1, 1920, in Dayton, Ohio.[94] Wetzel was a CIA employee in Shanghai, and later served as secretary[95] to W. Averell Harriman in Paris during the Marshall Plan. Hunt and Wetzel had four children, including two daughters, Lisa and Kevan, and two sons, St. John and David.[96]\n\nDorothy Hunt was killed in the December 8, 1972,[97] crash of United Airlines Flight 553 in Chicago. Congress, the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the crash, and concluded that the crash was caused by accidental crew error.[98]\n\nSome sources have suggested and stated that \"much more than\"[99] $10,000 in cash was found in Dorothy Hunt's handbag in the wreckage.[100]",
          "Marriage to Laura Martin": "Hunt later married teacher Laura Martin, with whom he raised two more children, Austin and Hollis. Following his release from prison, he and Laura moved to Guadalajara, Mexico, where they lived for five years before returning to the United States, where they settled in Miami.[101]",
          "Death": "On January 23, 2007, Hunt died of pneumonia in Miami, at age 88.[1][102] He is buried in Prospect Lawn Cemetery in his hometown of Hamburg, New York.[103][104]",

          "Early life and education": "Joannides attended the City College of New York and St. John's University School of Law.[1][2]",
          "Career": "Before 1949, he worked for the Greek diasporic newspaper National Herald. From 1949 to 1950, he worked in the press office of the Greek Embassy in Washington. In 1950, he joined the Central Intelligence Agency.[2]\n\nBy 1963, he was chief of the psychological warfare branch of Central Intelligence Agency's JMWAVE station in Miami under then-Deputy Director of Plans Richard \"Dick\" Helms,[3] with a staff of 24 and a budget of $1.5 million (equivalent to $15 million in 2024).[4][5] In that role, he was also known as \"Howard\", \"Mr. Howard\", and \"Walter Newby\".[6][7]\n\nJoannides directed and financed Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE), or Student Revolutionary Directorate, a group of Cuban exiles whose officers had contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in the months before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.[8][9][10] By some accounts, fashioned with the \"plausible deniability\" typical of CIA operations, the plan was designed to link Oswald to Castro's government, without disclosing the CIA's role. He left the agency in 1976 to start an immigration-law practice in Washington, DC.[1]\n\nIn 1978 the CIA summoned Joannides to serve as the agency's liaison to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), in specific regard to the death of President Kennedy. Washington Post reporter Jefferson Morley wrote that, \"the spy withheld information about his own actions in 1963 from the congressional investigators he was supposed to be assisting. It wasn't until 2001, 38 years after Kennedy's death, that Joannides' support for the Cuban exiles, who clashed with Oswald and monitored him, came to light.\"[11] G. Robert Blakey, the Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the HSCA, later said that Joannides \"obstructed our investigation\" and that if he had known about Joannides' Cuban operations he would have \"demanded that the agency take him off the job\" and \"sat him down and interviewed him. Under oath\".[12][13] Joannides retired permanently from the CIA in November 1978.[1] In July 1981, he was awarded the Career Intelligence Medal.[14]\n\nIn 2013, John R. Tunheim and Thomas E. Samoluk wrote in the Boston Herald:\n\nThere is a body of documents that the CIA is still protecting, which should be released. Relying on inaccurate representations made by the CIA in the mid-1990s, the Review Board decided that records related to a deceased CIA agent named George Joannides were not relevant to the Kennedy assassination. Subsequent work by researchers, using other records that were released by the board, demonstrates that these records should be made public.[15]\n\nIn 2022, the Mary Ferrell Foundation filed a lawsuit in an attempt to secure the release of the Joannides files.[16]",
          "Personal life and death": "Joannides was born on July 5 1922, in Athens, Greece. His family immigrated to New York in 1923.[2] In addition to speaking English, Joannides was fluent in Greek and French, and competent in Spanish. He and his wife Violet had three children, and lived in Pinecrest, Florida. In his later years, Joannides had heart problems and moved to Houston, Texas to receive medical treatment from Michael DeBakey. Joannides died on March 9, 1990, aged 67.[1]\n\n^\na b c d Revelation 19.63 Miami New Times\n^\na b c Papadopoulos, Pavlos (February 22, 2023). \"Τζορτζ Ιωαννίδης: Από τη δολοφονία Κένεντι, στα Ιουλιανά\".

          "Lead": "LyndaLuci\n\nLynda\n\nLuci\n\nClaudia Alta \"Lady Bird\" Johnson (née Taylor; December 22, 1912 – July 11, 2007) was First Lady of the United States from 1963 to 1969 as the wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson. She had previously been Second Lady of the United States from 1961 to 1963 when her husband was vice president under John F. Kennedy.\n\nNotably well educated for a woman of her era, Lady Bird proved a capable manager and a successful investor. After marrying Lyndon Johnson in 1934 when he was a political hopeful in Austin, Texas, she used a modest inheritance to bankroll his congressional campaign and then ran his office while he served in the Navy.\n\nAs first lady, Johnson broke new ground by interacting directly with Congress, employing her press secretary, and making a solo electioneering tour. She advocated beautifying the nation's cities and highways (\"Where flowers bloom, so does hope\"). The Highway Beautification Act was informally known as \"Lady Bird's Bill\". She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1984, the highest honors bestowed upon a U.S. civilian. Johnson has been consistently ranked in occasional Siena College Research Institute surveys as one of the most highly regarded American first ladies per historians' assessments.",
          "Early life": "Claudia Alta Taylor was born on December 22, 1912, in Karnack, Texas, a town in Harrison County, near the eastern state line with Louisiana.[1] Her birthplace was \"The Brick House\", an antebellum plantation house on the outskirts of town, which her father had purchased shortly before her birth.[2] She was a descendant of English Protestant martyr Rowland Taylor through his grandson Captain Thomas J. Taylor II.\n\nShe was named for her mother's brother Claud.[3] During her infancy, her nursemaid, Alice Tittle,[4][5] said that she was as \"pretty as a ladybird\".[6] Opinions differ about whether the name refers to a bird or a ladybird beetle, the latter of which is commonly referred to as a \"ladybug\" in North America.[4] The nickname virtually replaced her first name for the rest of her life. Her father and siblings called her Lady,[7] and her husband called her Bird—the name she used on her marriage license. During her teenage years, some classmates would call her Bird to provoke her since she reportedly was not fond of the name.[8]\n\nNearly all of her maternal and paternal immigrant ancestors arrived in the Virginia Colony during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, likely as indentured servants as were most early settlers in the colony. Her father, a native of Alabama, had primarily English ancestry and some Welsh and Danish. Her mother, also a native of Alabama, was of English and Scottish descent.[citation needed]\n\nHer father, Thomas Jefferson Jonson Taylor[9] (August 29, 1874 – October 22, 1960), was a sharecropper's son. He became a wealthy businessman and owned 15,000 acres (6,070 ha) of cotton and two general stores. \"My father was a very strong character, to put it mildly\", his daughter once said. \"He lived by his own rules. It was a whole feudal way of life, really.\"[5]\n\nHer mother, born Minnie Lee Pattillo (1874–1918), loved opera and felt out of place in Karnack; she was often in \"poor emotional and physical health\".[3] When Lady Bird was five years old, Minnie fell down a flight of stairs while pregnant. She died of complications of miscarriage in 1918.[3] In a profile of Lady Bird Johnson, Time magazine described Lady Bird's mother as \"a tall, eccentric woman from an old and aristocratic Alabama family, [who] liked to wear long white dresses and heavy veils [...] fussed over food fads, played grand opera endlessly on the phonograph, loved to read the classics aloud to tiny Lady Bird [... and who] scandalized people for miles around by entertaining Negroes in her home, and once even started to write a book about Negro religious practices, called Bio Baptism.\"[10][11] Her husband, however, tended to see black people as nothing more than \"hewers of wood and drawers of water\", according to his younger son Anthony.[10]\n\nLady Bird had two elder brothers, Thomas Jefferson Jr. (1901–1959) and Antonio, also known as Tony (1904–1986). Her widowed father married twice more. His second wife was Beulah Taylor, a bookkeeper at a general store.[12] His third wife was Ruth Scroggins, whom he married in 1937.[13]\n\nLady Bird was largely raised by her maternal aunt Effie Pattillo, who moved to Karnack after her sister's death. She also visited her Pattillo relatives in Autauga County, Alabama, every summer until she was a young woman. As she explained, \"Until I was about 20, summertime always meant Alabama to me. With Aunt Effie, we would board the train in Marshall and ride to the part of the world that meant watermelon cuttings, picnics at the creek, and a lot of company every Sunday.\"[14] According to Lady Bird, her Aunt Effie \"opened my spirit to beauty, but she neglected to give me any insight into the practical matters a girl should know about, such as how to dress or choose one's friends or learning to dance.\"[8]\n\nLady Bird was a shy and quiet girl who spent much of her youth alone outdoors. \"People always look back at it now and assume it was lonely,\" she once said about her childhood. \"To me it definitely was not. ... I spent a lot of time just walking and fishing and swimming.\"[15] She developed her lifelong love of the outdoors as a child growing up in the tall pines and bayous of East Texas, where she watched the wildflowers bloom each spring.[16]",
          "Education": "When it came time to enter high school,[15] Lady Bird had to move away and live with another family during weekdays in the town of Jefferson, Texas,[17] since there was no high school in the Karnack area. (Her brothers were sent to boarding schools in New York.) She graduated third in her class at the age of 15 from Marshall Senior High School in the nearby county seat. Despite her young age, her father gave her a car so that she could drive herself to school, a distance of 15 miles (24 km) each way. She said of that time, \"[I]t was an awful chore for my daddy to delegate some person from his business to take me in and out.\"[15] During her senior year, when she realized that she had the highest grades in her class, she \"purposely allowed her grades to slip\" so that she would not have to give the valedictorian or salutatorian speech.[4]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in May 1928, Lady Bird entered the University of Alabama for the summer session, where she took her first journalism course. But, homesick for Texas, she stayed home and did not return for the fall term at Alabama.[18] Instead, she and a high school friend enrolled at St. Mary's Episcopal College for Women,[19] an Episcopal boarding junior college for women in Dallas. It influenced her to \"convert to the Episcopal faith\", although she waited five years for confirmation.[20]\n\nAfter graduating from St. Mary's in May 1930, Lady Bird toyed with returning to Alabama. Another friend from Marshall was going to the University of Texas, so she chartered a plane to Austin to join her. As the plane landed, she was awed by the sight of a field covered with bluebonnets and instantly fell in love with the city.[21] Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history[22] with honors in 1933[23] and a second bachelor's degree in journalism cum laude in 1934.[24] She was active on campus in different organizations, including Texas Orange Jackets, a women's honorary service organization, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.[4]\n\nThe summer after her second graduation, she and a girlfriend traveled to New York City and Washington, where they peered through the fence at the White House.[4] Dallek described Lady Bird as having undergone a boost in her self-confidence through her years at the college. Her time there marked a departure from her timid behavior in her youth.[25]",
          "Marriage and family": "A friend in Austin introduced her to Lyndon B. Johnson, a 26-year-old Congressional aide with political aspirations,[26] working for Congressman Richard Kleberg.[4] Lady Bird recalled having felt \"like a moth drawn to a flame\".[27] Biographer Randall B. Woods attributed Johnson's \"neglect of his legal studies\" to his courting of Lady Bird.[28]\n\nOn their first date, at the Driskill Hotel,[5] Lyndon proposed. Lady Bird did not want to rush into marriage, but he was persistent and did not want to wait. Ten weeks later, Lady Bird accepted his proposal.[4] The couple married on November 17, 1934, at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nAfter she suffered three miscarriages,[4] the couple had two daughters together: Lynda Bird (born 1944) and Luci Baines (born 1947).[29] The couple and their two daughters all shared the initials LBJ. Their daughters lived in the White House during their teenage years, under media scrutiny.\n\nLynda Bird married Charles S. Robb in a White House ceremony. He was later elected governor of Virginia and U.S. Senator. Luci Baines married Pat Nugent in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and, later, Ian Turpin. Lady Bird had seven grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren at the time of her death.[4]\n\nTheir marriage, however, suffered due to Lyndon's numerous affairs[30]—in particular, the relationship between Lyndon and socialite Alice Marsh. This relationship was on and off between 1939 and the early years of his presidency and was eventually ended due to Marsh's opposition to the Vietnam War. Lady Bird Johnson's awareness of these infidelities was included in her 2007 obituary, noting that Lady Bird \"was openly humiliated\". Her husband would even brag that he had slept with more women than his predecessor, John F. Kennedy.[31]",
          "Early politics": "When Lyndon decided to run for Congress from Austin's 10th district, Lady Bird provided the money to launch his campaign. She took $10,000 of her inheritance from her mother's estate to help start his political career.[32] The couple settled in Washington, D.C., after Lyndon was elected to Congress.[33] After he enlisted in the Navy at the outset of the Second World War, Lady Bird ran his congressional office.[33]\n\nLady Bird sometimes served as a mediating force between her wilful husband and those he encountered. On one occasion after Lyndon had clashed with Dan Rather, then a young Houston reporter, Lady Bird followed Rather in her car. Stopping him, she invited him to return and have some punch, explaining, \"That's just the way Lyndon sometimes is.\"[34]\n\nDuring the years of the Johnson presidency, Lyndon, in one incident, yelled at the White House photographer who failed to show up for a photo shoot with the First Lady. She consoled the photographer afterward, who said that, despite his feelings against President Johnson, he \"would walk over hot coals for Lady Bird.\"[35]",
          "Business career": "In January–February 1943, during World War II, Lady Bird Johnson spent $17,500 of her inheritance to purchase KTBC, an Austin radio station.[2] She bought the radio station from a three-man partnership that included Robert B. Anderson, a future U.S. secretary of the navy and U.S. secretary of the treasury, and Texas oilman and rancher Wesley West.\n\nShe served as president of the LBJ Holding Co., and her husband negotiated an agreement with the CBS radio network. Despite Lyndon's objections, Lady Bird expanded by buying a television station in 1952. She reminded him that she could do as she wished with her inheritance.[4] The station, KTBC-TV/7 (then affiliated with CBS as well), was Austin's monopoly VHF franchise and generated revenues that made the Johnsons millionaires.[36] Over the years, journalists have revealed that Lyndon used his influence in the Senate to influence the Federal Communications Commission into granting the monopoly license, which was in Lady Bird's name.[37][38][39]\n\nLBJ Holding also had two small banks; they failed and were closed in 1991 by the FDIC. But the core Johnson radio properties survived and prospered. Emmis Communications bought KLBJ-AM, KLBJ-FM, KGSR, and three other stations from LBJ Holding in 2003 for $105 million.[40]\n\nEventually, Lady Bird's initial $41,000 investment turned into more than $150 million for the LBJ Holding Company.[41] She was the first president's wife to have become a millionaire in her own right before her husband was elected to office.[2] She remained involved with the company until she was in her eighties.[4]",
          "Second Lady of the United States": "John F. Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson as his running mate for the 1960 election. At Kennedy's request, Lady Bird took an expanded role during the campaign, as his wife Jacqueline was pregnant with their second child. Over 71 days, Lady Bird traveled 35,000 miles (56,000 km) through 11 states and appeared at 150 events.[4] Kennedy and Johnson won the election that November, with Lady Bird helping the Democratic ticket carry seven Southern states.[4]\n\nReflecting later, Lady Bird said that the years her husband served as vice president and she as Second Lady were \"a very different period of our lives.\" Nationally, the two had a kind of celebrity, but they both found the office of vice president to lack power.[42]\n\nAs the vice president's wife, Lady Bird often served as a substitute for Jacqueline Kennedy at official events and functions.[43] Within her first year as Second Lady, she had substituted for Mrs. Kennedy at more than 50 events, roughly one per week.[44] This experience prepared Lady Bird for the following challenges of her unexpected years as First Lady.[42]\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the Johnsons were accompanying the Kennedys in Dallas when President Kennedy was assassinated; they were two cars behind the President in his motorcade. Lyndon was sworn in as president on Air Force One two hours after Kennedy died, with Lady Bird and Jacqueline Kennedy by his side.[45] Afterward, Lady Bird created a tape on which she recorded her memories of the assassination, saying it was \"primarily as a form of therapy to help me over the shock and horror of the experience.\" She submitted a transcript of the tape to the Warren Commission as testimony. LBJ advisor Abe Fortas had made notations on her document to add detail.[46] In their plans for their trip to Texas, the Johnsons had intended to entertain the Kennedys that night at their ranch.[47]\n\nIn the days following the assassination, Lady Bird worked with Jacqueline Kennedy on the transition of her husband to the White House. While having great respect for Jacqueline and finding her strong in the aftermath of the murder, Lady Bird believed from the start of her tenure as first lady that she would be unfavorably compared to her immediate predecessor.[45] On her last day in the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy left Lady Bird a note in which she promised she would \"be happy\" there.[48]",
          "First Lady of the United States": "As first lady and trusted presidential confidant, Lady Bird Johnson helped establish the public environmental movement in the 1960s. She worked to beautify Washington, D.C., by planting thousands of flowers, set up the White House Natural Beauty Conference, and lobbied Congress for the president's full range of environmental initiatives. In 1965, she took the lead in calling for passage of the Highway Beautification Act. The act called for control of outdoor advertising, including removal of certain types of signs, along the nation's growing Interstate Highway System and the existing federal-aid primary highway system. It also required certain junkyards along Interstate or primary highways to be removed or screened and encouraged scenic enhancement and roadside development.[49] According to Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall, she single-handedly, \"influenced the president to demand-and support-more far-sighted conservation legislation.\"[50]\n\nHer capital beautification project turned the national capital into a showcase for the nation.[51] It was intended to improve physical conditions in Washington, D.C., for residents and tourists by planting millions of flowers, many of them on National Park Service land along roadways around the capital.[41] She said, \"Where flowers bloom, so does hope.\"\n\nShe worked extensively with the American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) executive Vice President Robert F. Lederer to protect wildflowers and promoted planting them along highways. Her efforts inspired similar programs throughout the country. She became the first president's wife to advocate actively for legislation[2] when she was instrumental in promoting the Highway Beautification Act, which was nicknamed \"Lady Bird's Bill\".[4] It was developed to beautify the nation's highway system by limiting billboards and by planting roadside areas. She was also an advocate of the Head Start program to give children from lower-income families a step up in school readiness.[2]\n\nLady Bird created the modern structure of the First Lady's office: she was the first in this role to have a press secretary and chief of staff of her own, and an outside liaison with Congress.[41] Her press secretary from 1963 to 1969 was Liz Carpenter, a fellow alumna of the University of Texas. As a mark of changing times, Carpenter was the first professional newswoman to become press secretary to a First Lady; she also served as Lady Bird's staff director. Lady Bird's tenure as First Lady marked the beginning of hiring employees in the East Wing to work specifically on the First Lady's projects.[36]\n\nPresident Johnson had initially said he would turn down the Democratic Party nomination for president in 1964, having been unhappy during his service in President Kennedy's administration and believing the party did not want him. Although aides could not sway him, the First Lady convinced him otherwise, reassuring him of his worthiness and saying that if he dropped out, the Republicans would likely take the White House.[52]\n\nDuring the 1964 campaign, Lady Bird traveled through eight Southern states from October 6 to 9 in a chartered train, the Lady Bird Special, at one point giving 45 speeches over four days.[36][41][53][54] It was the first solo whistle-stop tour by a First Lady.[34] In the same month, Lady Bird continued her campaign tour by airplane, with stops in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Indiana, and Kentucky.[55]\n\nIn the November 1964 presidential election, Johnson won a landslide victory over his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater. At the ceremony to swear in the new president, Lady Bird held the Bible as her husband took the oath of office on January 20, 1965, starting a tradition which continues.[56]\n\nOn September 22, 1965, Lady Bird dedicated a Peoria, Illinois, landscape plaza, with the president of the Peoria City Beautification Association, Leslie Kenyon, saying during the ceremony that Lady Bird was the first presidential spouse \"who has visited our city as an official guest in our 140 years of existence.\"[57]\n\nOn September 22, 1966, Lady Bird dedicated the Glen Canyon Dam in northern Arizona, fulfilling a goal that both presidents Kennedy and Johnson had sought to accomplish. She said the dam belonged to all Americans amid an increasing concern for water that affected every American \"no matter whether he lives in New York or Page, Arizona.\"[58]\n\nIn late-August 1967, Lady Bird traveled to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to attend the Expo 67, a White House aide saying she had been urged by the President to travel there since his own trip three months prior.[59]\n\nIn mid-September 1967, Lady Bird began touring the Midwestern United States as part of a trip that one White House described as \"mostly agriculture during the day and culture at night.\" President Johnson was then declining in support by farmers, months before a planned re-election bid.[60] Speaking to a crowd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on September 20, Lady Bird said problems within American cities were creating crime.[61]\n\nIn January 1968 at a White House luncheon,[62] Eartha Kitt, when asked by the first lady what her views were on the Vietnam War, replied: \"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. No wonder the kids rebel and take pot.\" Kitt's anti-war remarks reportedly angered Lyndon and Mrs. Johnson, and this resulted in the derailment of Kitt's professional career.[63][64][65][66]\n\nToward the end of Johnson's first term, Lady Bird was anxious for her husband to leave office.[67] In September 1967, Lady Bird voiced her concerns that a second term would be detrimental to his health. Health concerns may have been one of the reasons why President Johnson decided not to seek re-election.[68]\n\nIn 1970, Lady Bird published A White House Diary, her intimate, behind-the-scenes account of her husband's presidency spanning November 22, 1963, to January 20, 1969. Beginning with President Kennedy's assassination, she recorded the momentous events of her times, including the Great Society's War on Poverty; the national civil rights and social protest movements; her activism on behalf of the environment; and the Vietnam War.\n\nJohnson was acquainted with a long span of fellow first ladies, from Eleanor Roosevelt to Laura Bush. She was protected by the United States Secret Service for 44 years.[69]",
          "Historical assessments": "Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Johnson has ranked among the seven-most highly regarded first ladies in these surveys.[70] In terms of cumulative assessment, Johnson has been ranked:\n\n3rd-best of 42 in 1982[70]\n6th-best of 37 in 1993[70]\n7th-best of 38 in 2003[70]\n5th-best of 38 in 2008[70]\n7th-best of 39 in 2014[70]\n7th-best of 40 in 2020[71]\n\n3rd-best of 42 in 1982[70]\n\n6th-best of 37 in 1993[70]\n\n7th-best of 38 in 2003[70]\n\n5th-best of 38 in 2008[70]\n\n7th-best of 39 in 2014[70]\n\n7th-best of 40 in 2020[71]\n\nIn the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Johnson was ranked in the top five for six out of the ten criteria, ranking the 5th highest in background, 5th highest in intelligence, 5th highest in value to the country, 5th highest in integrity, 4th highest in her accomplishments, and 5th highest in leadership.[72] In additional questions asked in the 2014 survey, among 20th- and 21st-century American first ladies, historians assessed Johnson as the 5th easiest to imagine serving as president herself, having had the 5th-greatest public service after leaving the White House, and having been the 5th best in creating a lasting legacy.[70] In the 2014 survey, Johnson and her husband were also ranked the 10th highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a \"power couple\".[73] A supplementary question to respondents of the 2020 survey assessing the effectiveness of the signature initiatives of Johnson and all of the ten subsequent first ladies ranked Johnson's efforts promoting environmental protection and beautification as the most-effective initiative.[74]\n\nBiographer Betty Boyd Caroli said in 2015 of Johnson that,\n\nShe really invented the job of the modern first lady. She was the first one to have a big staff, the first one to have a comprehensive program in her own name, the first one to write a book about the White House years, when she leaves. She had an important role in setting up an enduring role for her husband with the LBJ Library. She's the first one to campaign extensively on her own for her husband.[75]\n\nWriting in 1986, William H. Inman observed that Johnson was considered by some \"the most effective First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt\", citing her battles against highway billboard forests, auto heaps, and junk piles as well as her support for American public landscapes maintaining beauty and sanity.[76]",
          "Later life": "Lyndon Johnson died of a heart attack in 1973, four years after leaving office.[36] When he suffered the heart attack, Lady Bird was in a meeting, and the former president had died when she reached him. She arranged for the body to lie in state at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and Museum the following day, and the body was laid to rest two days later. The couple's elder daughter, Lynda, said that God \"knew what he was doing\" when her father died ahead of her mother; she thought her father would not have been able to live without Lady Bird.[77] After his death, Lady Bird took time to travel and spent more time with her daughters.[78] She remained in the public eye, honoring her husband and other presidents. She entertained the wives of governors at the LBJ Presidential Library.[79]\n\nIn the 1970s, Johnson focused her attention on the Austin riverfront area through her involvement in the Town Lake Beautification Project. From 1971 to 1978, she served on the board of regents for the University of Texas System.[80] She also served on the National Park Service Advisory Board, and was the first woman to serve on National Geographic Society's board of trustees.[36] President Nixon mentioned her as a possible ambassador in a circulated memo, but never nominated her for office.[36]\n\nIn December 1973, after President Nixon established the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac, he notified Johnson via a telephone call.[81]\n\nIn August 1975, after First Lady Betty Ford made comments on sex, Johnson expressed sympathy: \"I know the pressures of being a First Lady, and I think maybe she got asked one question too quick.\"[82]\n\nDuring the 1976 United States presidential election, Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter apologized to Johnson over comments he made about her husband during an interview in which he stated he would not follow trends of \"lying, cheating, and distorting the truth\" set forth by former Presidents Nixon and Johnson.[83]\n\nIn November 1977, Johnson spoke at the 1977 National Women's Conference among other speakers including Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford, Bella Abzug, Barbara Jordan, Cecilia Burciaga, Gloria Steinem, Lenore Hershey and Jean O'Leary.[84]\n\nOn March 12, 1980, Johnson returned to the White House and attended a reception commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of the Head Start program. In his remarks, President Carter expressed gratitude for her attending as he stated \"she personifies too, as you know, the essence of what this great man did with those who worked around him\", referring to her late husband.[85]\n\nIn June 1981, officials of Dartmouth College stated that Johnson and former president Gerald Ford would serve as co-chairs of the fundraising committee for the Rockefeller Center for the Social Sciences.[86] Johnson later attended the dedication of the center in September 1983.[87]\n\nIn 1982, Johnson and actress Helen Hayes founded the National Wildflower Research Center west of Austin, Texas, as a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving and reintroducing native plants in planned landscapes.[88] In 1994, the center opened a new facility southwest of Austin; they officially renamed it the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1995[89] in acknowledgment of her having raised $10 million for the facility.[41] In 2006, the center was incorporated into the University of Texas at Austin.[89]\n\nIn 1988, Johnson convened with three other former first ladies—Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, and Pat Nixon—at the \"Women and the Constitution\" conference at The Carter Center to assess that document's impact on women. The conference featured over 150 speakers and 1,500 attendees from all 50 states and 10 foreign countries. The conference was meant to promote awareness on sexual inequality in other countries, and fight against it in America.[90]\n\nIn September 1991, Johnson unveiled a new line of English porcelain flower sculpture that drew influence from American wildflowers in the Corrigan's Jewelry at NorthPark Center in Dallas.[91]\n\nFor 20 years, Johnson spent her summers on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, renting the home of Charles Guggenheim for many of those years. She said she had greatly appreciated the island's natural beauty and flowers.[92]\n\nIn August 1984, Johnson publicly stated her support for the vice-presidential nomination of Geraldine Ferraro in that year's presidential election while admitting the difficulty the Mondale-Ferraro ticket faced in winning Texas.[93]\n\nJohnson returned to the White House for the twenty-fifth-anniversary celebration of her husband's inauguration on April 6, 1990. Incumbent president George H. W. Bush praised her for her support of her husband and work toward beautifying landscapes.[94]\n\nOn October 13, 2006, Johnson made a rare public appearance at the renovation announcement of the LBJ Library and Museum.",
          "Health problems and death": "In 1986, 13 years after her husband's death, Johnson's health began to fail. She suffered her first fainting spell that year while attending a funeral, and entered St. David's Community Hospital for observation. She also injured her left knee in a fall the day before her hospitalization.[95] In August 1993, she suffered a stroke and became legally blind due to macular degeneration. In 1999, she was hospitalized for a second fainting spell. In 2002, she suffered a second, more severe, stroke, which prevented her from speaking normally or walking without assistance. In 2005, she spent a few days in an Austin hospital for treatment of bronchitis. In February 2006, Lynda Johnson Robb told a gathering at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, that her mother was totally blind and was \"not in very good health\".[96] In June 2007, she spent six days in Seton Hospital in Austin after suffering from a low-grade fever.[97]\n\nLady Bird Johnson died at home on July 11, 2007, at 4:18 p.m. (CDT) from natural causes at the age of 94, attended by family members and Catholic priest Father Robert Scott.[98][99][100]\n\nAt the funeral service, her daughter, Luci Baines Johnson, gave a eulogy, saying, \"A few weeks before Mother died, I was taking visiting relatives to the extraordinary Blanton Art Museum ... Mother was on IV antibiotics, a feeding tube, and oxygen, but she wasn't gonna let little things like that deter her from discovering another great art museum. What a picture we were—literally rolling through the museum like a mobile hospital.\"[101]\n\nThree weeks before Johnson's death, the rector of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Fredericksburg, her second home for over 50 years, had announced to his parishioners that she had given $300,000 to pay off the church's mortgage.[102]\n\nJohnson's funeral was a public event. On July 15, 2007, a ceremonial cortège left the Texas State Capitol. The public was invited to line the route through downtown Austin on Congress Avenue and along the shores of Lady Bird Lake to pay their respects. The public part of the funeral procession ended in Johnson City. The family had a private burial at the Johnson family cemetery in Stonewall, where she is buried next to her husband, who had died 34 years earlier.[103] Unlike previous funerals for first ladies, the pallbearers came from members of the armed forces.[103][104]",
          "Honors": "On August 27, 1969, President Richard Nixon dedicated a 300-acre (120 ha) grove of redwood trees as the \"Lady Bird Johnson Grove\" due to her efforts as First Lady toward preserving national resources for Americans. The grove is located just north of Orick, California, and is part of Redwood National Park. Lady Bird attended the dedication with former President Johnson.[105]\n\nLady Bird Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford on January 10, 1977. The citation for her medal read:\n\nOne of America's great First Ladies, she claimed her own place in the hearts and history of the American people. In councils of power or in homes of the poor, she made government human with her unique compassion and her grace, warmth and wisdom. Her leadership transformed the American landscape and preserved its natural beauty as a national treasure.[17]\n\nShe received the Congressional Gold Medal in 1988, becoming the first wife of a president to receive the honor.[1] In a 1982 poll taken of historians ranking the most influential and important First Ladies, Lady Bird was ranked third—behind Abigail Adams and Eleanor Roosevelt—primarily for her work as a conservation activist.[4]\n\nIn 1995, the National Wildflower Research Center, near Austin, Texas, was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center. She and actress Helen Hayes founded the center in 1982.\n\nIn 1966, she was awarded the National Institute of Social Sciences Gold Medal for Services to Humanity.\n\nIn 1995, Lady Bird received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[106]\n\nIn November 1968, Columbia Island, in Washington, D.C., was renamed Lady Bird Johnson Park in honor of her campaign as first lady to beautify the capital. In 1976, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was dedicated on Columbia Island.[4]\n\nLady Bird declined many overtures to name Austin's Town Lake in her honor after she had led a campaign to clean up the lake and add trails to its shoreline; following her death, Austin Mayor Will Wynn's office said it was a \"foregone conclusion that Town Lake is going to be renamed\" in honor of Lady Bird Johnson.[17] The lake was renamed Lady Bird Lake on July 26, 2007.[107]\n\nIn April 2008, the \"Lady Bird Johnson Memorial Cherry Blossom Grove\" was dedicated to Marshfield, Missouri. The dedication took place during the city's annual cherry blossom festival. Johnson had supported the rural community and their initiative to plant ornamental cherry trees.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1995, she received an Honor Award from the National Building Museum for her lifetime leadership in beautification and conservation campaigns.[108] She was also named the honorary chairwoman of the Head Start program.[17]\n\nLady Bird held honorary degrees from many universities: Boston University; the University of Alabama; George Washington University; Johns Hopkins University; State University of New York; Southern Methodist University; Texas Woman's University; Middlebury College; Williams College, Southwestern University; Texas State University–San Marcos; Washington College; and St. Edward's University.[17]\n\nOn June 7, 2008, Texas honored Lady Bird by renaming the state convention's Blue Star Breakfast as the 'Lady Bird Breakfast'.[109] In January 2009, St. Edward's University in Austin completed a new residence hall for upperclassmen bearing the name of Lady Bird Johnson Hall, or \"LBJ Hall\" for short.[110]\n\nOn August 28, 2008, Lady Bird Johnson High School was opened in her name in San Antonio, Texas, a part of the North East Independent School District.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, the United States Postal Service announced the issue of a souvenir Forever stamp sheet honoring Lady Bird Johnson as a tribute to her legacy of beautifying the nation's roadsides, urban parks and trails. Five of the six stamps feature adaptations of stamps originally issued in the 1960s to promote planting in public spaces. The sixth stamp features her official White House portrait, a painting of the First Lady in a yellow gown, by Elizabeth Shoumatoff. The stamps were dedicated on November 30, 2012, at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center of The University of Texas at Austin.[111]\n\nIn 2013, Lady Bird was posthumously awarded the prestigious Rachel Carson Award. The award, presented by Audubon's Women in Conservation, was accepted by her daughter Lynda.[112]\n\n^\na b Hylton, Hilary (July 12, 2007). \"Lady Bird Johnson dies in Texas at age 94\". Reuters.

Johnson administration. He had previously served as United States Deputy Attorney General under President John F. Kennedy.",
          "Early life and education": "Katzenbach was born in Philadelphia and raised in Trenton, New Jersey. His parents were Edward L. Katzenbach, who served as Attorney General of New Jersey, and Marie Hilson Katzenbach, who was the first female president of the New Jersey State Board of Education. His uncle, Frank S. Katzenbach, served as Mayor of Trenton, New Jersey and as a Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n\nHe was named after his mother's great-great-grandfather, Nicolas de Belleville (1753–1831), a French medical doctor who accompanied Kazimierz Pułaski to America and settled in Trenton in 1778.[1][2] Katzenbach was raised an Episcopalian,[3][4] and was partly of German descent.[5]\n\nHe attended Phillips Exeter Academy and was accepted into Princeton University. Katzenbach was a junior at Princeton in 1941 who enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces right after Pearl Harbor and served in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II. He was assigned as a navigator in the 381st Bomb Squadron, 310th Bomb Group in North Africa. His B-25 Mitchell Bomber was shot down February 23, 1943, over the Mediterranean Sea off North Africa. He spent over two years as a prisoner of war in Italian and German POW camps, including Stalag Luft III, the site of the \"Great Escape\", in which Katzenbach assisted. He read extensively as a prisoner and ran an informal class based on Principles of Common Law.[6][7][8]\n\nHe received his A.B., cum laude, from Princeton University in 1945 (partly based on Princeton giving him credit for the 500-odd books he had read in captivity).[6] As part of his degree, Katzenbach completed a senior thesis titled The Little Steel Formula: An Historical Appraisal.[9] He received an LL.B., cum laude, from Yale Law School in 1947, where he served as editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal.[10] From 1947 to 1949, he was a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nOn June 8, 1946, Katzenbach married Lydia King Phelps Stokes, in a ceremony officiated by her uncle, Anson Phelps Stokes, former canon of the Washington National Cathedral. Her father was Harold Phelps Stokes, a newspaper correspondent and secretary to Herbert Hoover.[11]\n\nKatzenbach was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1950 and the Connecticut bar in 1955. He was an associate in the law firm of Katzenbach, Gildea and Rudner in 1950.",
          "Government service": "From 1950 to 1952, he was attorney-advisor in the Office of General Counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force. Katzenbach was on the faculty of Rutgers Law School from 1950 to 1951; was an associate professor of law at Yale from 1952 to 1956; and was a professor of law at the University of Chicago from 1956 to 1960.\n\nHe served in the U.S. Department of Justice as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel in 1961–1962 and as Deputy Attorney General appointed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. After the assassination of President Kennedy, Katzenbach continued to serve with the Johnson administration. On February 11, 1965 President Johnson appointed Katzenbach the 65th Attorney General of the United States, and he held the office until October 2, 1966. He then served as Under Secretary of State from 1966 to 1969. While Under Secretary of State, he commented on the 1967 USS Liberty incident: “There was nobody I think who did not believe that the Israelis knew it was an American ship that they were attacking.”[12]\n\nIn September 2008, Katzenbach published Some of It Was Fun: Working with RFK and LBJ (W. W. Norton), a memoir of his years in Government service.",
          "The \"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door\"": "On June 11, 1963, Katzenbach was a primary participant in one of the most famous incidents of the Civil Rights struggle.[13] Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in front of Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama in an attempt to stop desegregation of that institution by the enrollment of two black students, Vivian Malone and James Hood. This became known as the \"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door\". Hours later, Wallace stood aside only after being ordered to do so by Alabama National Guard General Henry V. Graham.[14]",
          "Role in JFK assassination investigation": "Katzenbach has been credited with providing advice after the assassination of John F. Kennedy that led to the creation of the Warren Commission.[15] On November 25, 1963, he sent a memo to Johnson's White House aide Bill Moyers recommending the creation of a Presidential Commission to investigate the assassination.[15][16] To combat speculation of a conspiracy, Katzenbach said the results of the FBI's investigation should be made public.[15][16] He wrote, in part: \"The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large\".[16]\n\nFour days after Katzenbach's memo, Johnson appointed some of the nation's most prominent figures, including the Chief Justice of the United States, to the Commission.[15][16] Conspiracy theorists later called the memo, one of thousands of files released by the National Archives in 1994, the first sign of a cover-up by the government.[15][16]",
          "Later years": "Katzenbach left government service to work for IBM in 1969, where he served as general counsel during the lengthy antitrust case filed by the Department of Justice seeking the break-up of IBM. He and Cravath, Swaine & Moore attorney Thomas Barr led the case for the computer giant for 13 years until the government finally decided to drop it in 1982. Later Katzenbach led the opposition against the case filed by the European Economic Community.\n\nHe retired from IBM in 1986 and became a partner at the firm of Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti in New Jersey.[17] He was named chairman of the failing Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991.[18]\n\nIn 1980, Katzenbach testified in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for the defense of W. Mark Felt, later revealed to be the \"Deep Throat\" of the Watergate scandal and later Deputy Director of the FBI; accused and later found guilty of ordering illegal wiretaps on American citizens.\n\nIn December 1996, Katzenbach was one of New Jersey's fifteen members of the Electoral College, who cast their votes for the Clinton/Gore ticket.[19]\n\nKatzenbach also testified on behalf of President Clinton on December 8, 1998, before the House Judiciary Committee hearing, considering whether to impeach President Clinton.[20]\n\nIn July 2002, Katzenbach joined the board of MCI Communications. In March 2004, he was elected as non-executive chairman of the MCI's board, effective after MCI emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MCI later merged with Verizon.[21]\n\nKatzenbach was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[22] and the American Philosophical Society.[23]\n\nKatzenbach and his wife Lydia retired to the Princeton, New Jersey area, with a summer home in West Tisbury, Massachusetts on Martha's Vineyard.[24] His son is writer John Katzenbach. His daughter, Maria, is also a published novelist.[25]\n\nAfter the death of W. Willard Wirtz in April 2010, Katzenbach became the oldest surviving former U.S. Cabinet member. Katzenbach died at his home in the Skillman section of Montgomery Township, New Jersey, on May 8, 2012, at the age of 90.[26]\n\nSome of It Was Fun: Working with RFK and LBJ (W. W.

Kennedy. A popular first lady, she endeared herself to the American public with her devotion to her family, dedication to the historic preservation of the White House, the campaigns she led to preserve and restore historic landmarks and architecture along with her interest in American history, culture, and arts. During her lifetime, she was regarded as an international icon for her unique fashion choices, and her work as a cultural ambassador of the United States made her very popular globally.[1]\n\nAfter studying history and art at Vassar College and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in French literature from George Washington University in 1951, Bouvier started working for the Washington Times-Herald as an inquiring photographer.[2] The following year, she met then-Congressman John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts at a dinner party in Washington. He was elected to the Senate that same year, and the couple married on September 12, 1953, in Newport, Rhode Island. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy. Following her husband's election to the presidency in 1960, Kennedy was known for her highly publicized restoration of the White House and emphasis on arts and culture as well as for her style. She also traveled to many countries where her fluency in foreign languages and history made her very popular.[3][4] At age 33, she was named Time magazine's Woman of the Year in 1962.\n\nAfter her husband's assassination and funeral in 1963, Kennedy and her children largely withdrew from public view. In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, which caused controversy. Following Onassis's death in 1975, she had a career as a book editor in New York City, first at Viking Press and then at Doubleday, and worked to restore her public image. Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable first ladies in American history, and in 1999, she was placed on the list of Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century.[5] She died in 1994 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery alongside President Kennedy and two of their children, one stillborn and one who died shortly after birth.[6] Surveys of historians conducted periodically by the Siena College Research Institute since 1982 have consistently found Kennedy Onassis to rank among the most highly regarded first ladies.",
          "Family and childhood": "Jacqueline Lee Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou \"Black Jack\" Bouvier III and socialite Janet Norton Lee.[7] Her mother was of Irish descent,[8] and her father had French, Scottish, and English ancestry.[9][b] Named after her father, she was baptized at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan and raised in the Roman Catholic faith.[12] Caroline Lee, her younger sister, was born four years later on March 3, 1933.[13]\n\nJacqueline Bouvier spent her early childhood years in Manhattan and at Lasata, the Bouviers' country estate in East Hampton on Long Island.[14] She looked up to her father, who likewise favored her over her sister, calling his elder child \"the most beautiful daughter a man ever had\".[15] Biographer Tina Santi Flaherty reports Jacqueline's early confidence in herself, seeing a link to her father's praise and positive attitude to her, and her sister Lee Radziwill stated that Jacqueline would not have gained her \"independence and individuality\" had it not been for the relationship she had with their father and paternal grandfather, John Vernou Bouvier Jr.[16][17] From an early age, Jacqueline was an enthusiastic equestrienne and successfully competed in the sport, and horse-riding remained a lifelong passion.[16][18] She took ballet lessons, was an avid reader, and excelled at learning foreign languages, including French, Spanish, and Italian.[19] French was particularly emphasized in her upbringing.[20]\n\nIn 1935, Jacqueline Bouvier was enrolled in Manhattan's Chapin School, where she attended grades 1–7.[18][21] She was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as \"a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil\".[22] Her mother attributed this behavior to her finishing her assignments ahead of classmates and then acting out in boredom.[23] Her behavior improved after the headmistress warned her that none of her positive qualities would matter if she did not behave.[23]\n\nThe marriage of the Bouviers was strained by the father's alcoholism and extramarital affairs; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the Wall Street Crash of 1929.[14][24] They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split.[25] According to her cousin John H. Davis, Jacqueline was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a \"tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own.\"[14] When their mother married stockbroker and lawyer Hugh D. Auchincloss Jr., the Bouvier sisters did not attend the ceremony because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to World War II.[26] They gained three stepsiblings from Auchincloss's previous marriages, Hugh \"Yusha\" Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss. Jacqueline formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants.[26] The marriage later produced two more children, Janet Jennings Auchincloss in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947.[27]\n\nAs a wedding gift, Mr. Auchincloss presented his new wife, Janet, with a car. But, being in the depths of World War II, no new cars were being produced. So, Mr. Auchincloss gave her a like-new 1940 Ford Deluxe Convertible. Jacqueline, 13 at the time, learned to drive in this 1940 Ford. She continued using the car with her siblings through the 1940s. Shortly before her graduation from George Washington University in 1951, the Auchincloss family sold the Ford. The car now resides in the Crumpley Family Collection in Texas.\n\nAfter the remarriage, Auchincloss's Merrywood estate in McLean, Virginia, became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, and in their father's homes in New York City and Long Island.[14][28] Although she retained a relationship with her father, Jacqueline Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure.[14] He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she otherwise would have never experienced.[29] While adjusting to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.[30]\n\nAfter seven years at Chapin, Jacqueline Bouvier attended the Holton-Arms School in Northwest Washington, D.C., from 1942 to 1944 and Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, from 1944 to 1947.[8] She chose Miss Porter's because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes.[31] In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for \"her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife\". She later hired her childhood friend Nancy Tuckerman to be her social secretary at the White House.[32] She graduated among the top students of her class and received the Maria McKinney Memorial Award for Excellence in Literature.[33]",
          "College and early career": "In the fall of 1947, Jacqueline Bouvier entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, at that time a women's institution.[34] She had wanted to attend Sarah Lawrence College, closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more isolated Vassar.[35] She was an accomplished student who participated in the school's art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper.[14][36] Due to her dislike of Vassar's location in Poughkeepsie, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan for the weekends.[37] She had made her debut to high society in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions. Hearst columnist Igor Cassini dubbed her the \"debutante of the year\".[38] She spent her junior year (1949–1950) in France—at the University of Grenoble in Grenoble, and at the Sorbonne in Paris—in a study-abroad program through Smith College.[39] Upon returning home, she transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature in 1951.[27] During the early years of her marriage to John F. Kennedy, she took continuing education classes in American history at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.[27]\n\nWhile attending George Washington, Jacqueline Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at Vogue magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide.[40] The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris.[40] Before beginning the job, she celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer.[40] The trip was the subject of her only autobiography, One Special Summer, co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline Bouvier's drawings.[41] On her first day at Vogue, the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. She followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.[40]\n\nBouvier moved back to Merrywood and was referred by a family friend to the Washington Times-Herald, where editor Frank Waldrop hired her as a part-time receptionist.[42] A week later she requested more challenging work, and Waldrop sent her to city editor Sidney Epstein, who hired her as an \"Inquiring Camera Girl\" despite her inexperience, paying her $25 a week.[43] He recalled, \"I remember her as this very attractive, cute-as-hell girl, and all the guys in the newsroom giving her a good look.\"[44] The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses.[14] In addition to the random \"man on the street\" vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six-year-old Tricia Nixon. Bouvier interviewed Tricia a few days after her father Richard Nixon was elected to the vice presidency in the 1952 election.[45] During this time, Bouvier was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named John Husted. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in The New York Times in January 1952.[46] After three months, she called off the engagement because she had found him \"immature and boring\" once she got to know him better.[47][48]",
          "Marriage to John F. Kennedy": "Jacqueline and U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy met at a dinner party hosted by journalist Charles L. Bartlett in May 1952.[14] She was attracted to Kennedy's physical appearance, wit and wealth. The pair also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad.[49] Kennedy was busy running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the November election. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the coronation of Elizabeth II in London for The Washington Times-Herald.[22]\n\nAfter a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. She then resigned from her position at the newspaper.[50] Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953. She was 24 and he was 36.[51][52] Bouvier and Kennedy married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island, in a Mass celebrated by Boston's Archbishop Richard Cushing.[53] The wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated 700 guests at the ceremony and 1,200 at the reception that followed at Hammersmith Farm.[54] The wedding dress was designed by Ann Lowe of New York City, and is now housed in the Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston. The dresses of her attendants were also created by Lowe, who was not credited by Jacqueline Kennedy.[55]\n\nThe newlyweds honeymooned in Acapulco, Mexico, before settling in their new home, Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.[56] Kennedy developed a warm relationship with her parents-in-law, Joseph and Rose Kennedy.[57][58][59] In the early years of their marriage, the couple faced several personal setbacks. John Kennedy suffered from Addison's disease and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain, which had been exacerbated by a war injury; in late 1954, he underwent a near-fatal spinal operation.[60] Additionally, Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and in August 1956 gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Arabella.[61][62] They subsequently sold their Hickory Hill estate to Kennedy's brother Robert, who occupied it with his wife Ethel and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in Georgetown.[8] The Kennedys also resided at an apartment at 122 Bowdoin Street in Boston, their permanent Massachusetts residence during John's congressional career.[63][64]\n\nKennedy gave birth to daughter Caroline on November 27, 1957.[61] At the time, she and her husband were campaigning across Massachusetts for his re-election to the Senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the April 21, 1958, issue of Life magazine.[65][c][which?] They traveled together during the campaign as part of their efforts to reduce the physical separation that had characterized the first five years of their marriage. Soon enough, John Kennedy started to notice the value his wife added to his congressional campaign. Kenneth O'Donnell remembered \"the size of the crowd was twice as big\" when she accompanied her husband; he also recalled her as \"always cheerful and obliging\". John's mother Rose, however, observed that Jacqueline was not \"a natural-born campaigner\" due to her shyness and was uncomfortable with too much attention.[67] In November 1958, John was reelected to a second term. He credited Jacqueline's visibility in the ads and stumping as vital assets in securing his victory and called her \"simply invaluable\".[68][69]\n\nIn July 1959, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. visited the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts and had his first conversation with Jacqueline Kennedy; he found her to have \"tremendous awareness, an all-seeing eye and a ruthless judgment\".[70] That year, John Kennedy traveled to 14 states, but Jacqueline took long breaks from the trips to spend time with their daughter, Caroline. She also counseled her husband on improving his wardrobe in preparation for the presidential campaign planned for the following year.[71] In particular, she traveled to Louisiana to visit Edmund Reggie and to help her husband garner support in the state for his presidential bid.[72]",
          "Campaign for presidency": "On January 2, 1960, John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, announced his candidacy for the presidency at the Russell Senate Office Building, and launched his campaign nationwide. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline Kennedy accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle-stops and dinners.[73] Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. Due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown.[74][75] Jacqueline subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, \"Campaign Wife\", answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.[22]\n\nDespite her non-participation in the campaign, Kennedy became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices.[76] On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women in the world.[77] On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press.[77] In order to downplay her wealthy background, Kennedy stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.[77]\n\nOn July 13, at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, the party nominated John F. Kennedy for president. Jacqueline did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier.[78] She was in Hyannis Port when she watched the September 26, 1960 debate—which was the nation's first televised presidential debate—between her husband and Republican candidate Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. Marian Cannon, the wife of Arthur Schlesinger, watched the debate with her. Days after the debates, Jacqueline Kennedy contacted Schlesinger and informed him that John wanted his aid along with that of John Kenneth Galbraith in preparing for the third debate on October 13; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches.[79][which?] On September 29, 1960, the Kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on Person to Person, interviewed by Charles Collingwood.[78]",
          "As first lady": "On November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon in the U.S. presidential election.[22] A little over two weeks later on November 25, Jacqueline Kennedy gave birth to the couple's first son, John F. Kennedy Jr.[22] She spent two weeks recuperating in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son's conditions were reported by the media in what has been considered the first instance of national interest in the Kennedy family.[81]\n\nKennedy's husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961. At 31, Kennedy was the third youngest woman to serve as first lady, as well as the first Silent Generation first lady.[22] She insisted they also kept a family home away from the public eye and rented Glen Ora at Middleburg.[82] As a presidential couple, the Kennedys differed from the Eisenhowers by their political affiliation, youth, and their relationship with the media. Historian Gil Troy has noted that in particular, they \"emphasized vague appearances rather than specific accomplishments or passionate commitments\" and therefore fit in well in the early 1960s' \"cool, TV-oriented culture\".[83] The discussion about Kennedy's fashion choices continued during her years in the White House, and she became a trendsetter, hiring American designer Oleg Cassini to design her wardrobe.[84] She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary, Pamela Turnure, and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed.[85][86] The media portrayed Kennedy as the ideal woman, which led academic Maurine Beasley to observe that she \"created an unrealistic media expectation for first ladies that would challenge her successors\".[86] Nevertheless, she attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.[87]\n\nAlthough Kennedy stated that her priority as a first lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history.[88][89] The restoration of the White House was her main contribution, but she also furthered the cause by hosting social events that brought together elite figures from politics and the arts.[88][89] One of her unrealized goals was to found a Department of the Arts, but she did contribute to the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, established during Johnson's tenure.[89]\n\nKennedy had visited the White House on two occasions before she became first lady: the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of outgoing First Lady Mamie Eisenhower shortly before her husband's inauguration.[88] She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance[88] and made it her first major project as first lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator Sister Parish. She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert Henry du Pont.[88] To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration.[88] Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, Jacqueline Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden after her husband's assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history. She helped to stop the destruction of historic buildings along the square, including the Renwick Building, now part of the Smithsonian Institution, and her support of historic preservation also reached beyond the United States as she brought international attention to the thirteenth-century B.C. temples of Abu Simbel that were in danger of being flooded by Egypt's Aswan Dam.[88]\n\nPrior to Kennedy's years as first lady, presidents and their families had taken furnishings and other items from the White House when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. She personally wrote to possible donors in order to track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest.[90] Jacqueline Kennedy initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the Smithsonian Institution rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own. She also founded the White House Historical Association, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, the position of a permanent Curator of the White House, the White House Endowment Trust, and the White House Acquisition Trust.[91] She was the first presidential spouse to hire a White House curator.[85]\n\nOn February 14, 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy, accompanied by Charles Collingwood of CBS News, took American television viewers on a tour of the White House. In the tour, she stated, \"I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best.\"[91] The film was watched by 56 million television viewers in the United States,[88] and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson. Kennedy was the only first lady to win an Emmy.[85]\n\nJackie Kennedy was a cultural ambassador of the United States known for her cultural and diplomatic work globally and would travel sometimes without President Kennedy to different countries to promote cultural exchange and diplomatic relations. She was highly regarded by foreign dignitaries, as she used her fluency in foreign languages such as French, Spanish, and Italian, as well as her cultural knowledge, to establish strong relationships with foreign leaders and to give speeches. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor, the highest civilian award given by the French government, becoming the initial First Lady and first American woman to be such a recipient. Her role as a cultural ambassador had a significant impact on cultural diplomacy and helped strengthen ties between the United States and other countries.\n\nJacqueline's language skills and cultural knowledge were highly respected by the French people, and her visit to France with President Kennedy in 1961 was seen as a great success. During the visit, she made a speech in French at the American University in Paris, which was widely praised for its eloquence. In her speech, Jacqueline Kennedy spoke about the importance of cultural exchange between France and the United States, and she emphasized the shared values and history of the two nations.\n\nThroughout her husband's presidency and more than any of the preceding first ladies, Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President.[27] Despite the initial worry that she might not have \"political appeal\", she proved popular among international dignitaries.[83] Before the Kennedys' first official visit to France in 1961, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history.[92] At the conclusion of the visit, Time magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, \"There was also that fellow who came with her.\" Even President Kennedy joked: \"I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris – and I have enjoyed it!\"[93][94]\n\nFrom France, the Kennedys traveled to Vienna, Austria, where Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was asked to shake the President's hand for a photo. He replied, \"I'd like to shake her hand first.\"[95] Khrushchev later sent her a puppy, Pushinka; the animal was significant for being the offspring of Strelka, the dog that had gone to space during a Soviet space mission.[96]\n\nAt the urging of U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962. The tour was amply documented in photojournalism as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. The president of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, had given her a horse named Sardar as a gift. He had found out on his visit to the White House that he and the First Lady had a common interest in horses.[97] Life magazine correspondent Anne Chamberlin wrote that Kennedy \"conducted herself magnificently\" although noting that her crowds were smaller than those that President Dwight Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II attracted when they had previously visited these countries.[98] In addition to these well-publicized trips during the three years of the Kennedy administration, she traveled to countries including Afghanistan, Austria, Canada,[99] Colombia, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Mexico,[100] Morocco, Turkey, and Venezuela.[27] Unlike her husband, Kennedy was fluent in Spanish, which she used to address Latin American audiences.[101]\n\nIn early 1963, Kennedy was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented on Squaw Island, which was near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7 (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. The infant's lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital, where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth.[102][103] Kennedy had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son and was present when he died. On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen who had gathered in her suite. In appreciation, she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.[104]\n\nThe First Lady was deeply affected by Patrick's death[105] and proceeded to enter a state of depression.[106] However, the loss of their child had a positive impact on the marriage and brought the couple closer together in their shared grief.[105] Arthur Schlesinger wrote that while John Kennedy always \"regarded Jackie with genuine affection and pride,\" their marriage \"never seemed more solid than in the later months of 1963\".[107][which?] Jacqueline Kennedy's friend Aristotle Onassis was aware of her depression and invited her to his yacht to recuperate. President Kennedy initially had reservations, but he relented because he believed that it would be \"good for her\". The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration, by much of the general public, and in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963. She would later say she regretted being away as long as she was but had been \"melancholy after the death of my baby\".[106]",
          "Assassination and funeral of John F. Kennedy": "On November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President embarked on a political trip to Texas with several goals in mind. This was the first time that she had joined her husband on such a trip in the U.S.[108] After a breakfast on November 22, they took a very short flight on Air Force One from Fort Worth's Carswell Air Force Base to Dallas's Love Field, accompanied by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie.[109] The First Lady was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat,[1][110] which had been personally selected by President Kennedy.[111] A 9.5-mile (15.3 km) motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart, where the president was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated to her husband's left in the third row of seats in the presidential car, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle backfiring. She did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for something coming off the right rear bumper of the car.[112] Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[113] She would later testify that she saw pictures \"of me climbing out the back. But I don't remember that at all\".[114]\n\nThe President was rushed for the 3.8-mile (6.1 km) trip to Parkland Hospital. At the First Lady's request, she was allowed to be present in the operating room.[115][page needed] President Kennedy never regained consciousness. He died not long after, aged 46. After her husband was pronounced dead, Kennedy refused to remove her blood-stained clothing and reportedly regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands, explaining to Lady Bird Johnson that she wanted \"them to see what they have done to Jack\".[116] She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she boarded Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as president. The unlaundered suit became a symbol of her husband's assassination, and was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964. Under the terms of an agreement with her daughter, Caroline, the suit will not be placed on public display before 2103.[117][118] Johnson's biographer Robert Caro wrote that Johnson wanted Jacqueline Kennedy to be present at his swearing-in in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of his presidency to JFK loyalists and to the world at large.[119]\n\nKennedy took an active role in planning her husband's state funeral, modeling it after Abraham Lincoln's service.[120] She requested a closed casket, overruling the wishes of her brother-in-law, Robert.[121] The funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington D.C., with the burial taking place at nearby Arlington National Cemetery. Kennedy led the procession on foot and lit the eternal flame—created at her request—at the gravesite. Lady Jeanne Campbell reported back to the London Evening Standard: \"Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people ... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty.\"[120]\n\nA week after the assassination,[122] new president Lyndon B. Johnson issued an executive order that established the Warren Commission—led by Chief Justice Earl Warren—to investigate the assassination. Ten months later, the Commission issued its report finding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone when he assassinated President Kennedy.[123] Privately, his widow cared little about the investigation, stating that even if they had the right suspect, it would not bring her husband back.[124] Nevertheless, she gave a deposition to the Warren Commission.[d] Following the assassination and the media coverage that had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Kennedy stepped back from official public view, apart from a brief appearance in Washington to honor the Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.",
          "Mourning period and later public appearances": "Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot.\n\nThere'll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another Camelot.[127]\n\nOn November 29, 1963—a week after her husband's assassination—Kennedy was interviewed in Hyannis Port by Theodore H. White of Life magazine.[128] In that session, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to King Arthur's mythical Camelot, commenting that the President often played the title song of Lerner and Loewe's musical recording before retreating to bed. She also quoted Queen Guinevere from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt.[129] The era of the Kennedy administration has subsequently been referred to as the \"Camelot Era\", although historians have later argued that the comparison is not appropriate, with Robert Dallek stating that Kennedy's \"effort to lionize [her husband] must have provided a therapeutic shield against immobilizing grief.\"[130]\n\nKennedy and her children remained in the White House for two weeks following the assassination.[131] Wanting to \"do something nice for Jackie\", President Johnson offered an ambassadorship to France to her, aware of her heritage and fondness for the country's culture, but she turned the offer down, as well as follow-up offers of ambassadorships to Mexico and the United Kingdom. At her request, Johnson renamed the Florida space center the John F. Kennedy Space Center a week after the assassination. Kennedy later publicly praised Johnson for his kindness to her.[132]\n\nKennedy spent 1964 in mourning and made few public appearances. In the winter following the assassination, she and the children stayed at Averell Harriman's home in Georgetown. On January 14, 1964, Kennedy made a televised appearance from the office of the Attorney General, thanking the public for the \"hundreds of thousands of messages\" she had received since the assassination, and said she had been sustained by America's affection for her late husband.[133] She purchased a house for herself and her children in Georgetown but sold it later in 1964 and bought a 15th-floor penthouse apartment for $250,000 at 1040 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in the hopes of having more privacy.[134][135][136]\n\nIn the following years, Kennedy attended selected memorial dedications to her late husband.[e] She also oversaw the establishment of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration.[140] Designed by architect I.M. Pei, it is situated next to the University of Massachusetts campus in Boston.[141]\n\nDespite having commissioned William Manchester's authorized account of President Kennedy's death, The Death of a President, Kennedy was subject to significant media attention in 1966–1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block its publication.[142][143][144] They sued publishers Harper & Row in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed President Kennedy's private life.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War in November 1967, Life magazine dubbed Kennedy \"America's unofficial roving ambassador\" when she and David Ormsby-Gore, former British ambassador to the United States during the Kennedy administration, traveled to Cambodia, where they visited the religious complex of Angkor Wat with Chief of State Norodom Sihanouk.[145][146] According to historian Milton Osborne, her visit was \"the start of the repair to Cambodian-US relations, which had been at a very low ebb\".[147] She also attended the funeral services of Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1968, despite her initial reluctance due to the crowds and reminders of President Kennedy's death.[148]",
          "Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy": "After her husband's assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy relied heavily on her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy; she observed him to be the \"least like his father\" of the Kennedy brothers.[149] He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital.[150] In the aftermath of the assassination, Robert became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as attorney general required him to reduce attention.[133] He credited her with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States senator from New York.[151]\n\nThe January 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam resulted in a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, and Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. When Art Buchwald asked him if he intended to run, Robert replied, \"That depends on what Jackie wants me to do\".[152][153] She met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him not to follow Jack, but to \"be yourself\". Privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that Bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was \"so much hatred\" in the United States.[154] She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was \"fatalistic\" like her.[152] Despite her concerns, Jacqueline Kennedy campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him,[155] and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.[152]\n\nJust after midnight PDT on June 5, 1968, an enraged Jordanian gunman named Sirhan Sirhan mortally wounded Robert Kennedy minutes after he and a crowd of his supporters had been celebrating his victory in the California Democratic presidential primary.[156] Jacqueline Kennedy rushed to Los Angeles to join his wife Ethel, her brother-in-law Ted, and the other Kennedy family members at his bedside in Good Samaritan Hospital. Robert Kennedy never regained consciousness and died the following day. He was 42 years old.[157]",
          "Marriage to Aristotle Onassis": "After Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Kennedy reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior.[158] She came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: \"If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country.\"[159]\n\nOn October 20, 1968, Jacqueline Kennedy married her long-time friend Aristotle Onassis, a Greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children.[159] The wedding took place on Skorpios, Onassis's private Greek island in the Ionian Sea.[160] After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis and consequently lost her right to Secret Service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife Athina Livanos was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be excommunicated by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by Boston's archbishop, Cardinal Richard Cushing, as \"nonsense\".[161] She was condemned by some as a \"public sinner\",[162] and became the target of paparazzi who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her \"Jackie O\".[163]\n\nIn 1968, billionaire heiress Doris Duke, with whom Jacqueline Onassis was friends, appointed her as the vice president of the Newport Restoration Foundation. Onassis publicly championed the foundation.[164][165]\n\nDuring their marriage, Jacqueline and Aristotle Onassis inhabited six different residences: her 15-room Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, her horse farm in Peapack-Gladstone, New Jersey,[166] his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht Christina O. Onassis ensured that her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family by having Ted Kennedy visit them often.[167] She developed a close relationship with Ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances.[168]\n\nAristotle Onassis's health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son Alexander in a plane crash in 1973.[169] He died of respiratory failure aged 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Jacqueline Onassis eventually accepted a settlement of $26 million from Christina Onassis—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir—and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.[170]",
          "Later years (1975–1990s)": "After the death of her second husband, Onassis returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years.[f]\n\nAfter almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, Onassis attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery.[172][173] She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 after John Leonard of The New York Times stated that she held some responsibility for Viking's publication of the Jeffrey Archer novel Shall We Tell the President?, set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and describing an assassination plot against him.[174][175] Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced that he was going to challenge incumbent president Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president.[176] She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.[177]\n\nFollowing her resignation from Viking Press, Onassis was hired by Doubleday, where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, John Turner Sargent, Sr. Among the books she edited for the company are Larry Gonick's The Cartoon History of the Universe,[178] the English translation of the three volumes of Naghib Mahfuz's Cairo Trilogy (with Martha Levin),[179] and autobiographies of ballerina Gelsey Kirkland,[180] singer-songwriter Carly Simon,[181] and fashion icon Diana Vreeland.[180] She also encouraged Dorothy West, her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and one of the last surviving members of the Harlem Renaissance, to complete the novel The Wedding (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S. The book was later adapted as a miniseries in 1998, starring Halle Berry and Lynn Whitfield and produced by Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions.\n\nIn addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation. In the 1970s, she led a historic preservation campaign to save Grand Central Terminal from demolition and renovate the structure in Manhattan.[182] A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle that would have cast large shadows on Central Park;[182] the project was canceled. A later project proceeded despite protests: a large twin-towered skyscraper, the Time Warner Center, was completed in 2003. Her historic preservation efforts also include her influence in the campaign to save Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in upstate New York. She was awarded the Fine Arts Federation medal for her devotion to the cause of historic preservation in New York City.[183]\n\nOnassis remained the subject of considerable press attention,[184] especially from the paparazzi photographer Ron Galella, who followed her around and photographed her as she went about her normal activities; he took candid photos of her without her permission.[185][186] She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him, and the situation brought attention to the problem of paparazzi photography.[187][g] From 1980 until her death, Onassis maintained a close relationship with Maurice Tempelsman, a Belgian-born industrialist and diamond merchant who was her companion and personal financial adviser.[190]\n\nIn 1988, Onassis became a first-time grandmother when her daughter Caroline – married to designer Edwin Schlossberg – gave birth to daughter Rose,[191] followed by Tatiana Celia (b. 1990) and John Bouvier (b. 1993).[191] Caroline would later recall: \"I have never seen her so happy as when she's around the kids.\"[191]\n\nIn the early 1990s, Onassis supported Bill Clinton and contributed money to his presidential campaign.[192] Following the election, she met with First Lady Hillary Clinton and advised her on raising a child in the White House.[193] In her memoir Living History, Clinton wrote that Onassis was \"a source of inspiration and advice for me\".[192] Democratic consultant Ann Lewis observed that Onassis had reached out to the Clintons \"in a way she has not always acted toward leading Democrats in the past\".[194]",
          "Illness, death, and funeral": "In November 1993, Onassis was thrown from her horse while participating in a fox hunt in Middleburg, Virginia, and was taken to the hospital to be examined. A swollen lymph node was discovered in her groin, which was initially diagnosed by the doctor to be caused by an infection.[195] The fall from the horse contributed to her deteriorating health over the next six months.[196] In December, Onassis developed new symptoms, including a stomach ache and swollen lymph nodes in her neck, and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma.[195][197] She began chemotherapy in January 1994 and publicly announced the diagnosis, stating that the initial prognosis was good.[195] She continued to work at Doubleday, but by March the cancer had spread to her spinal cord, brain and liver and by May it was deemed terminal.[195][197]\n\nOnassis made her last trip home from New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center on May 18, 1994.[195][197] The following night at 10:15 p.m., she died in her sleep in her Manhattan apartment at age 64, with her children by her side.[197] In the morning, her son, John F. Kennedy Jr., announced his mother's death to the press stating that she had been \"surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved\". He added that \"she did it in her very own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that.\"[198]\n\nOn May 23, 1994, her funeral Mass was held a few blocks away from her apartment at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola—the Catholic parish where she was baptized in 1929 and confirmed as a teenager—and asked for no cameras to film the event, for privacy.[199][200] She was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella.[14][195] President Bill Clinton delivered a eulogy at her graveside service.[201][202]\n\nShe left an estate that its executors valued at US$43.7 million (equivalent to $92.7 million in 2024).[203]",
          "Popularity": "Jacqueline Kennedy's marriage to Aristotle Onassis caused her popularity to decline sharply among an American public who viewed it as a betrayal of the assassinated president.[205][206] Her lavish lifestyle as Onassis's \"trophy wife\",[207] in contrast to \"the shy, selfless, and sacrificing mother the American public had come to respect\" as First Lady,[208] led the press to portray her as \"a spendthrift and a reckless woman\".[209]\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis took conscious control of her public image and, by the time of her death, succeeded in rehabilitating it.[210] By moving back to New York City after Onassis's death, working as an editor for Viking Press and Doubleday, focusing on her children and grandchildren, and participating in charitable causes, she reversed her \"reckless spendthrift\" image.[211] She also reestablished her relationship with the Kennedy family and supported the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum.[212]\n\nOnassis remains one of the most popular First Ladies. She was featured 27 times on the annual Gallup list of the top 10 most admired people of the second half of the 20th century; this number is surpassed by only Billy Graham and Queen Elizabeth II and is higher than that of any U.S. president.[213]\n\nBoth Tina Turner[214] and Jackie Joyner-Kersee[215] have cited Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as an influence.",
          "Style icon": "Jacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend Oleg Cassini to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.[216]\n\nKennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of Chanel, Balenciaga, and Givenchy, but was aware that in her role as first lady, she would be expected to wear American designers' work.[217] After noticing that her taste for Paris fashion was being criticized in the press, she wrote to the fashion editor Diana Vreeland to ask for suitable American designers, particularly those who could reproduce the Paris look.[217] After considering the letter, which expressed her dislike of prints and her preference for \"terribly simple, covered-up clothes,\" Vreeland recommended Norman Norell, who was considered America's first designer and known for his high-end simplicity and fine quality work. She also suggested Ben Zuckerman, another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the sportswear designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies.[217] Kennedy's first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a Pierre Cardin design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the White House with Mamie Eisenhower.[217]\n\nIn her role as first lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless A-line dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and pillbox hats.[216] Dubbed the \"Jackie\" look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world. More than any other First Lady, her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women.[27] Her influential bouffant hairstyle, described as a \"grown-up exaggeration of little girls' hair,\" was created by Mr. Kenneth, who worked for her from 1954 until 1986.[218][219] Her tastes in eyewear were also influential, the most famous of which were the bespoke pairs designed for her by French designer, François Pinton. The coinage 'Jackie O glasses' is still used today to refer to this style of oversized, oval-lensed sunglasses.[220]\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Kennedy underwent a style change. Her new looks consisted of wide-leg pantsuits, silk Hermès headscarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses.[221] She began wearing jeans in public as part of a casualization of her look.[222]\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis acquired a large collection of jewelry throughout her lifetime. Her triple-strand pearl necklace, designed by American jeweler Kenneth Jay Lane, became her signature piece of jewelry during her time as first lady in the White House. Often referred to as the \"berry brooch\", the two-fruit cluster brooch of strawberries made of rubies with stems and leaves of diamonds, designed by French jeweler Jean Schlumberger for Tiffany & Co., was personally selected and given to her by her husband several days prior to his inauguration in January 1961.[223] She wore Schlumberger's gold and enamel bracelets so frequently in the early and mid-1960s that the press called them \"Jackie bracelets\"; she also favored his white enamel and gold \"banana\" earrings. Kennedy wore jewelry designed by Van Cleef & Arpels throughout the 1950s,[224] 1960s[224] and 1970s; her sentimental favorite was the Van Cleef & Arpels wedding ring given to her by President Kennedy.\n\nKennedy, a Catholic, was known for wearing a mantilla at Mass and in the presence of the Pope.[225]\n\nMary Tyler Moore's Dick Van Dyke Show character Laura Petrie, who symbolized the \"feel-good nature\" of the Kennedy White House, often dressed like Kennedy.[226]\n\nKennedy was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965.[227][228] Many of her signature clothes are preserved at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum; pieces from the collection were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2001. Titled \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years\", the exhibition focused on her time as a first lady.[229]\n\nIn 2012, Time magazine included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on its All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons list.[230] In 2016, Forbes included her on the list \"10 Fashion Icons and the Trends They Made Famous\".[231]",
          "Historical assessments": "In 2020, Time magazine included her name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was named Woman of the Year 1962 for her efforts in uplifting the American history and art.[232]\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis is seen as being customary in her role as first lady,[233][234] though Frank N. Magill argued that her life was validation that \"fame and celebrity\" changed the way that first ladies are evaluated historically.[235] Hamish Bowles, curator of the \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years\" exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attributed her popularity to a sense of unknown that was felt in her withdrawal from the public which he dubbed \"immensely appealing\".[236] After her death, Kelly Barber referred to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as \"the most intriguing woman in the world\", furthering that her stature was also due to her affiliation with valuable causes.[237] Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony summarized that the former first lady \"became an aspirational figure of that era, one whose privilege might not be easily reached by a majority of Americans but which others could strive to emulate\".[213] Since the late 2000s, Onassis's traditional persona has been invoked by commentators when referring to fashionable political spouses.[238][239] A wide variety of commentators have positively credited the work of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in restoring the White House, including Hugh Sidey,[213][240] Letitia Baldrige,[241] Laura Bush,[242] Kathleen P. Galop,[243] and Carl Anthony.[244]\n\nSince 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Onassis has ranked among the three-eight highly regarded first ladies in these surveys.[245] In terms of cumulative assessment, Onassis has been ranked:\n\n8th-best of 42 in 1982[245]\n7th-best of 37 in 1993[245]\n4th-best of 38 in 2003[245]\n3rd-best of 38 in 2008[245]\n3rd-best of 39 in 2014[245]\n4th-best of 40 in 2020[246]\n\n8th-best of 42 in 1982[245]\n\n7th-best of 37 in 1993[245]\n\n4th-best of 38 in 2003[245]\n\n3rd-best of 38 in 2008[245]\n\n3rd-best of 39 in 2014[245]\n\n4th-best of 40 in 2020[246]\n\nIn the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Onassis was ranked in the top-five of all criteria, ranking the 2nd-highest in background, 4th-highest in intelligence, 2nd-highest in value to the country, 4th-highest in being her \"own woman\", 4th-highest in integrity, 5th-highest in her accomplishments, 2nd-highest in courage, 4th-highest in leadership, 1st in public image, and 3rd-highest in her value to the president.[247] In the 2003 survey, Onassis made the top-five in half of the categories, being ranked 1st-highest in background, 5th-highest in intelligence, 4th-highest in courage, 4th-highest in value to the country, and 1st-highest in public image.[248] In the 2014 Siena Research Institute survey, in the rankings of 20th and 21st century American first ladies in additional survey questions, Onassis was ranked 2nd-highest for management of family life, 4th-highest for advancement of women's issues, 3rd-greatest as a political asset, 4th-strongest public communicator, and 2nd-highest for creation of a lasting legacy.[245] In the 2014 survey, Onassis and her first husband were also ranked the 6th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a \"power couple\".[249]\n\nIn the 1982 Siena College Research Institute survey, Onassis had been ranked the lowest in the criteria of integrity. In subsequent iterations of the survey, historians' regard for her integrity markedly improved. The initial disapproving view of her integrity may have been due to sentiments towards her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Historians' overall opinions towards Onassis as a whole appear to have become more favorable in the subsequent years as she, in her second widowhood, demonstrated her independence with her career in publishing.[250]",

          "Portrayals": "Jaclyn Smith portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1981 television film Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, depicting her life until the end of the JFK presidency.[264] The film's producer Louis Rudolph stated an interest in creating a \"positive portrait of a woman who I thought had been very much maligned,\" comments that were interpreted by John J. O'Connor of The New York Times as erasing any chances of critique toward her.[265] Though Smith received praise for her performance,[266] with Marilynn Preston calling her \"convincing in an impossible role\",[267] Tom Shales wrote \"Jaclyn Smith couldn't act her way out of a Gucci bag\".[268]\n\nBlair Brown portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1983 miniseries Kennedy, set during the Kennedy presidency.[269] Brown used wigs and makeup to better resemble Kennedy and said through playing the role she gained a different view of the assassination: \"I realized that this was a woman witnessing the public execution of her husband.\"[270] Jason Bailey praised her performance,[271] while Andrea Mullaney noted her resemblance to Kennedy and general shyness.[272] Brown was nominated for a television BAFTA as Best Actress and a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.[273]\n\nMarianna Bishop, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Roma Downey portray Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 1991 miniseries A Woman Named Jackie, covering her entire life until the death of Aristotle Onassis.[274] Of being contacted for the role, Downey reflected: \"I thought I was a strange choice because I didn't think I looked anything like her and I was Irish.\"[275] Half of Downey's wardrobe was designed by Shelley Komarov[276] and Downey stated that though she had long harbored \"great respect and admiration\" for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, she was unaware of the troubles in her childhood.[277] Reviewer Rick Kogan praised Downey with doing \"a surprisingly fine job in the demanding title role\",[278] while Howard Rosenberg lamented Downey's performance failing to \"pierce this thick glaze of superficiality\".[279] Ability credited the role with raising Downey's profile.[280] In 1992, the miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries.[281]\n\nRhoda Griffis portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1992 film Love Field, set shortly before and in the aftermath of JFK's assassination.[282] It was Griffis's feature film debut.[283] Griffis said she had been told by her orthodontist of her resemblance to Kennedy and was cast as her upon walking into the auditions for the role.[284]\n\nSally Taylor-Isherwood, Emily VanCamp, and Joanne Whalley portray Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 2000 television miniseries Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, covering chronologically her entire life.[285] Whalley prepared for the role by listening to recordings of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's voice along with working with a dialect coach; by the end of production, she developed an attachment to her.[286] Laura Fries assessed Whalley as lacking Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's charisma despite being \"soulful and regal\" in her own right[287] while Ron Wertheimer viewed Whalley as being passive in the role and lamented \"the filmmakers render Jackie as Forrest Gump in a pillbox hat, someone who keeps passing close to the center of things without really touching – or being touched by – very much.\"[288]\n\nStephanie Romanov portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2000 film Thirteen Days, taking place during the Cuban Missile Crisis.[289] Philip French of The Guardian noted her small role and being out of \"the loop\" was accurate of women's roles in \"the early Sixties\".[290] Laura Clifford called Romanov \"unconvincing\" in the role.[291]\n\nJill Hennessy portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2001 television film Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot.[292][293] Hennessy prepared for the performance by watching hours of archival footage of Kennedy and cited one of the reasons for her favoring of the miniseries was its distinctiveness in not focusing \"strictly on the men or only on Jackie\".[294] Reviewers Anita Gates[295] and Terry Kelleher[296] believed Hennessy brought \"elegance\" to the role while Steve Oxman panned the performance: \"Hennessy simply doesn't possess the right natural grace. But this pic has a habit of telling us more that [sic] it shows us, and the actress manages to communicate the most important elements of the story without ever making it especially convincing.\"[297]\n\nJacqueline Bisset portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2003 film America's Prince: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story.[298] Bisset said the glasses she used during the film were holdovers from a prior role in The Greek Tycoon.[299] Neil Genzlinger thought Bisset \"should have known better\" in taking on the role[300] while Kristen Tauer wrote Bisset portraying Kennedy as a mother was a \"different central light than many proceeding films\".[301]\n\nJeanne Tripplehorn portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2009 film Grey Gardens for a single scene.[302][303] Tripplehorn said questions she had about Edith Bouvier Beale that she thought would be answered by being a part of the film remained unresolved.[304] Tripplehorn received diverse reactions to her performance[305][306][307] while Brian Lowry noted her resemblance to Kennedy and small role.[308]\n\nKatie Holmes portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries The Kennedys, set during the Kennedy presidency and its 2017 sequel The Kennedys: After Camelot, focusing on her life after 1968.[309][310] Mary McNamara[311] and Hank Stuever[312] regarded Holmes's performance with neutrality in their reviews of The Kennedys while Hadley Freeman called her \"bloodless\" in the role.[313] Holmes stated reprising the role was a \"bigger challenge\" for having to act through later periods of Kennedy's life.[314] When asked of the concurrent Jackie film, Holmes said, \"I think its [sic] really exciting. It's [sic] just is a testament to how amazing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was and how much she meant to our country.\"[315] Holmes also stated both should be watched due to covering different periods of Jackie's life.[316] In The Kennedys: After Camelot, Holmes's performance was viewed favorably by Daniel Feinberg[317] and Allison Keane[318] while Kristi Turnquist panned her.[319]\n\nMinka Kelly portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2013 film The Butler, giving the film's protagonist Cecil one of her husband's neckties after his assassination.[320][321] Kelly said she was intimidated and scared taking on the role.[322] Kelly admitted to having difficulty with perfecting Kennedy's voice, going \"to sleep listening to her\", and having discomfort with the wool clothing associated with the role.[321]\n\nGinnifer Goodwin portrays her in the 2013 television film Killing Kennedy.[323][324] Goodwin used intimate photos to better portray Jacqueline Kennedy and was concerned \"to do her justice and to play her as accurately as possible without ever doing an impression of her\".[325] Costar Rob Lowe said of seeing Goodwin in the pink Chanel suit, \"It made it real. If I were under any illusions about what we were doing, seeing her in that iconic moment was, I would say, sobering.\"[326] Tom Carson wrote that Goodwin's \"trademark vulnerability humanizes Jackie considerably\"[327] while Bruce Miller called her a miscast[328] and Robert Lloyd[329] and Brian Lowry[330] panned her performance.\n\nKim Allen portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2016 film LBJ.[331] Ray Bennett noted in his review of the film that Allen was in a non-speaking role.[332]\n\nNatalie Portman portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2016 film Jackie, set during the JFK presidency and the immediate aftermath of the assassination.[333][334] Portman admitted being intimidated taking the role and doing research in preparation for filming.[335] Nigel M. Smith wrote that by portraying Kennedy, Portman was \"taking on arguably the biggest challenge of her career\".[336] Manohla Dargis,[337] David Edelstein,[338] and Peter Bradshaw[339] praised her performance. Portman was nominated for Best Actress by Academy Awards,[340] AACTA Awards,[341] AWFJ,[342] AFCA,[343] and BSFC,[344] and won the category by the Online Film Critics Society.[345]\n\nJodi Balfour portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2017 eighth episode of the second season of Netflix's drama series, The Crown, titled \"Dear Mrs. Kennedy\", set during the June 1961 visit of the Kennedy couple to Buckingham Palace and the immediate reaction to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[346]\n\nBouvier family\nKennedy family\nKennedy curse\n\nBouvier family\n\nKennedy family\n\nKennedy curse\n\nBiography portal\nUnited States portal\nPolitics portal\nLiterature portal\n\nBiography portal\n\nUnited States portal\n\nPolitics portal\n\nLiterature portal\n\n^ Nicknamed \"Jackie O\" following her second marriage.\n^ Her French family had its origins in the Rhone River valley village of Pont-Saint-Esprit and left France for the US in the first years of the 19th century.[10] Although the French and English ancestors of the Bouviers were mostly middle class, her paternal grandfather John Vernou Bouvier Jr., fabricated a more noble ancestry for the family in his vanity family history book, Our Forebears, later disproved by the research by her cousin John Hagy Davis.[11]\n^ At first she had opposed the magazine's offer of the cover, not wanting the baby to be used to benefit her husband's political career, but she had changed her mind in exchange for a promise from her father-in-law that John would stop campaigning during the summer to go to Paris with her.[66]\n^ There were some mixed feelings about whether she should testify, Earl Warren in particular indicating an unwillingness to interview her while John J. McCloy outright opposed such an inquiry. Future president Gerald Ford, who served on the Warren Commission, proposed \"most informally\" having her interviewed by an associate.[125] With the varying opinions of what to do lingering, Warren held a short meeting with Kennedy at her apartment.[125][126]\n^ In May 1965, she, Robert and Ted Kennedy joined Queen Elizabeth II at Runnymede, England, where they dedicated the United Kingdom's official memorial to JFK. The memorial included several acres of meadowland given in perpetuity from the UK to the US, near where King John had signed Magna Carta in 1215.[137] In 1967, she attended the christening of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)[138] in Newport News, Virginia, a memorial in Hyannis Port, and a park near New Ross, Ireland. She also attended a private ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery that saw the moving of her husband's coffin, after which he was reinterred so that officials at the cemetery could construct a safer and more stable eternal flame and accommodate the tourists' extensive foot traffic.[139]\n^ Prior to her publishing employment, she had gained experience by being involved with several posthumous biographies of President Kennedy. The first of these was John F. Kennedy, President, by Hugh Sidey, which was published the year after his death in 1964. Simon Michael Bessie, Sidey's editor at Atheneum, recalled her as having read galleys and submitted detailed notes on them. Despite this recollection, Sidey did not acknowledge her contribution in the book. The following year, she helped Ted Sorensen with his book Kennedy. Sorensen told Greg Lawrence that after finishing the \"first draft\" of his \"first big book\", he gave Onassis the manuscript since he thought she would be helpful, and she provided him with several comments on the book. Sorensen lauded her assistance in his memoir Counselor, as he wrote that she had \"proved to be a superb editor, correcting typographical errors, challenging mistaken assumptions, defending some of her husband's personnel decisions, suggesting useful clarifications, and repeatedly setting the record straight on matters not known to me\".[171]\n^ In the mid-1970s, photos of Onassis sunbathing in the nude had been published without her permission in the pornographic magazines Playmen, Screw, and Hustler.[188][189]\n\n^ Nicknamed \"Jackie O\" following her second marriage.\n\n^ Her French family had its origins in the Rhone River valley village of Pont-Saint-Esprit and left France for the US in the first years of the 19th century.[10] Although the French and English ancestors of the Bouviers were mostly middle class, her paternal grandfather John Vernou Bouvier Jr., fabricated a more noble ancestry for the family in his vanity family history book, Our Forebears, later disproved by the research by her cousin John Hagy Davis.[11]\n\n^ At first she had opposed the magazine's offer of the cover, not wanting the baby to be used to benefit her husband's political career, but she had changed her mind in exchange for a promise from her father-in-law that John would stop campaigning during the summer to go to Paris with her.[66]\n\n^ There were some mixed feelings about whether she should testify, Earl Warren in particular indicating an unwillingness to interview her while John J.

          "Lead": "Malcolm MacGregor \"Mac\" Kilduff Jr. (September 26, 1927 – March 3, 2003) was an American journalist, best known for making the public announcement of the death of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.[1]\n\nMac Kilduff was Kennedy's assistant White House Press Secretary, and the ranking press secretary on Kennedy's November 1963 trip to Dallas, Texas where Kennedy was assassinated.[2]",
          "Biography": "Kilduff was born in Staten Island, New York City. He grew up in Arlington, Virginia, and went to Washington-Lee High School. He served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1947. He went to George Washington University and Harvard University. Kilduff also went to the Arlington Institute of Law.[1]",
          "November 22, 1963": "President John F. Kennedy made a trip to Texas in November 1963, accompanied by his wife Jacqueline Kennedy, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Johnson's wife Lady Bird Johnson, and others. Kilduff was acting press secretary for the trip because the main White House press secretary, Pierre Salinger, was traveling to Japan with six members of the Cabinet, including Secretary of State Dean Rusk, for a joint meeting with the Japanese Cabinet.[3][4][5][6]\n\nPresident Kennedy was shot at about 12:30 p.m. CST on November 22, 1963, while riding in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza.[7] He was rushed to Dallas's Parkland Memorial Hospital.[8] The doctors at Parkland pronounced the president dead at about 1 pm CST.[9][10]",
          "Announcing death of JFK": "It fell to Kilduff to bring the news from Kennedy's trauma room to Vice President Johnson waiting in another room in the hospital. Kilduff simply walked up to Johnson and addressed him as \"Mr. President.\"[11] Lady Bird Johnson let out a short scream as the news hit.[12]\n\nKilduff asked for Johnson's approval to announce Kennedy's death to the public. Johnson ordered that the announcement of the president's death be made only after he left the hospital. Johnson told him:\n\nI think I had better get out of here ... before you announce it. We don't know whether this is a worldwide conspiracy, whether they are after me as well as they were after President Kennedy, or whether they are after Speaker (John W.) McCormack, or Senator (Carl) Hayden. We just don't know.[13]\n\nJohnson left the hospital and was driven back to Air Force One at Dallas Love Field.[11] He later recounted to Merle Miller: \"I asked that the announcement be made after we had left the room...so that if it were an international conspiracy and they were out to destroy our form of government and the leaders in that government, that we would minimize the opportunity for doing so.\"[14]\n\nAfter Kilduff received confirmation that Johnson was back at Air Force One, Kilduff announced President Kennedy's death to the press assembled in a nurse's classroom at Parkland Hospital, at 1:33 p.m. CST (19:33 UTC),[10] saying:\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy died at approximately 1:00 Central Standard Time today here in Dallas. He died of a gunshot wound to the brain. I have no other details regarding the assassination of the president.[11][15]\n\nKilduff then followed Johnson back to Air Force One. While Johnson took the oath of office of the president of the United States, Kilduff made the only audio recording of the event, by holding up a Dictabelt Dictaphone which had been on the president's desk, the only audio recording device Kilduff could locate aboard the plane.[16]",
          "Later career": "Kilduff continued to serve as Assistant Press Secretary for the Johnson administration until 1965, when he resigned to start a public relations agency.[17]\n\nHe later worked as an editor for The Beattyville Enterprise newspaper in Beattyville, Kentucky. After his divorce from his first wife, Bonnie, Kilduff had met and married a Beattyville native, Rosemary Porter Kilduff, who had worked in Washington, D.C. as an aide to U.S. Sen. Vance Hartke. Upon her retirement from government service, the Kilduffs moved back to her childhood home in Beattyville, on a hill overlooking the town's east side and the nursing home where he eventually died. While editor of The Beattyville Enterprise, Kilduff won a number of Kentucky Press Association awards. Rosemary was also a columnist for the paper and was also an award-winning journalist. One of her columns, dealing with methods of forecasting the weather in mountain folklore, became the impetus for the town's annual fall festival, the Woolly Worm Festival, held the third weekend in October.\n\nIn Beattyville, Kilduff was active in the Kiwanis Club, the Natural Bridge Park Association, and the Buckhorn Scenic Trails Association. He was also an admitted recovering alcoholic and often spoke to students and civic groups not only about his experience with President Kennedy but of his experiences with alcoholism and his recovery.\n\nRosemary Kilduff preceded her husband in death and is buried in the Proctor Cemetery in Lee County, Kentucky, across the Kentucky River from Beattyville.\n\nKilduff died in retirement at a nursing home in Beattyville at age 75 in March 2003 . He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.[18][19]",

          "Lead": "Karyn Kupcinet (born Roberta Lynn Kupcinet; March 6, 1941 – November 28, 1963) was an American stage, film, and television actress. She was the daughter of Chicago newspaper columnist and television personality Irv Kupcinet, and the sister of television director and producer Jerry Kupcinet.\n\nKupcinet had a brief acting career during the early 1960s. Six days after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, her body was found at her home in West Hollywood, California. With her death officially ruled an unsolved homicide, and occurring so close to the assassination, her name became one of hundreds added to the multiplicity of theories that emerged after the assassination.\n\nKupcinet's father publicly dismissed the theories linking his daughter to the president's death. In 1992, after NBC's Today program briefly referred via a caption to her alleged connection to the assassination, Irv Kupcinet described the broadcast as \"an atrocious outrage\" and \"calumny\". Karyn Kupcinet's death remains officially unsolved.",
          "Early life": "Karyn Kupcinet was born Roberta Lynn Kupcinet in Chicago, Illinois, to Irv Kupcinet, a sportswriter for the Chicago Daily Times, and his wife, Esther Kupcinet (née Solomon). Her younger brother, Jerry Kupcinet, was a director and producer in television. She was of Russian Jewish ancestry.[1] She acquired the nickname \"Cookie\" during her childhood. Kupcinet made her acting debut at age 13 in the Chicago production of Anniversary Waltz and went on to attend Pine Manor College for a semester, eventually studying at the Actors Studio in New York City.[2]",
          "Career": "Kupcinet's interest in acting was encouraged by her mother,[2] and she was afforded access to producers through the reputation of her father.[2] In 1961, Jerry Lewis offered Kupcinet a role in the film The Ladies Man, where she appeared in a bit part as one of dozens of young ladies in a Hollywood boardinghouse. In 1962, she appeared in the role of Annie Sullivan in a Laguna Beach summer theater production of The Miracle Worker.[2] She also appeared in guest roles on television, including The Donna Reed Show, The Wide Country, G.E. True, Going My Way, The Andy Griffith Show, and Death Valley Days. In addition to guest spots, Kupcinet had a regular role in the prime-time series Mrs. G. Goes to College (retitled The Gertrude Berg Show during its short run).[4]\n\nKupcinet's last onscreen appearance was on Perry Mason in the role of Penny Ames, in an episode entitled \"The Case of the Capering Camera\". The episode aired on CBS on January 16, 1964,[5] nearly two months after her death.\n\nKupcinet worked as a model and stage actress before she arrived in Hollywood. Her mother Esther \"Essee\" Kupcinet lived vicariously through her daughter. It was she who started her on that path; she wanted to create a star.[7]\n\nWhile still in diapers, Essee began to groom Karyn for stardom. “This is the child who was supposed to live out her dream,” said Peggy Schatz, friend of the family.[8]\n\nShe made her debut on the public stage at just five and a half months old as a model, her mother arranging for her to appear in baby clothing and accessories advertisements. In the years that followed Karyn's modelling career continued steadily, she appeared in advertising campaigns in national newspapers, magazines and then TV commercials. Family cook John Clark said in an interview ”the girl was talked into being an actress by her mother”, before she could read her governess took her to acting lessons when Essee had other plans and read the scripts to her, Karyn would memorise it and perform little shows on cue for family and friends. At just three years of age she made her entry into theatre with appearances in several 'Little Theatre' productions, designed to groom children to be future stage actors.[2]\n\nShe made her professional acting debut in 1955 at age 13 in the Chicago production of 'Anniversary Waltz' by Jerome Chodorov. understudy of rising star Carol Lynley (1942-2019), also making her debut in that play.[9]\n\nShe attended the Francis W. Parker School in Chicago, starring in the school production of Pygmalion and graduating in the class of 1958. Her year book describes her as a fan of the musical Summer Stock and a future actress who is at home on the stage. She studied at Pine Manor College, was invited to join the production of Wozzyck with the Harvard University Drama Club before heading to New York to study at the Actor's Studio under Lee Strasberg, Herbert Bergoff, Marc Daniels and Martha Graham.[10]\n\nWhen she left for California at age 20 to try her hand at motion pictures she already had a substantial body of professional acting work under her belt, having appeared in; 'Apollo of Bellac' - 'The Royal Family' with Linda Darnell. 'The Chalk Garden' with Penny Wood. 'Jenny Kissed Me', 'Time of the Cukoo' and appeared opposite Darren McGavin in the 1956 season of 'Picnic' for which she received rave reviews. She loved the stage and would prove her mettle starring in a production of 'Father of the Bride', appearing for 15 gruelling weeks in Florida opposite veteran actor Pat O'Brien.[11]\n\nIt was reported that she originally appeared on screen as Tammy Windsor and officially as Karyn Kupcinet in the movie 'The Ladies Man' (1961) starring Jerry Lewis. That is not true, Tammy Windsor was a different person all together. Before her career was tragically cut short Karyn made a great start, she appeared credited and unaccredited in 31 movies, television shows and TV commercials. She also boosted her image and supplemented her income modelling and appeared regularly on stage, stage was her forte, 1962 was a busy year; she appeared in the Laguna Beach Summer Theatre production of 'The Miracle Worker'. Reprised her role as Kay in another production of \"Father of the Bride\" and also appeared that year in 'Sunday in New York' back home in Chicago.[2]",
          "Personal life": "By 1961, Kupcinet was living in Hollywood and getting positive reviews for her acting.[12] She had a relationship with Skip Ward, whom she met on the series in which they both appeared. In December 1962 she filmed a guest-star appearance on The Wide Country and had her first meeting with one of the series' stars, Andrew Prine,[13] and began dating him.[2][13] However, the relationship was problematic due to Karyn wanting to make the relationship exclusive. Prine was newly divorced and was dating other people. After Kupcinet underwent an alleged abortion in July 1963, the relationship cooled further and Prine continued dating other women. In turn, Kupcinet began spying on Prine and his new girlfriend.[2] One afternoon upon returning to his residence with a girlfriend, they heard noises in the attic and called the police. The authorities discovered Karyn Kupcinet in the attic, stalking Prine and his friends.[citation needed]\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department later determined Kupcinet had delivered threatening and profane messages, consisting of words and letters she had cut out of magazines, to Prine and herself.[2] When Prine told her by telephone about anonymous messages that had been Scotch-taped to the door of his Los Angeles house,[13] she said she had received them as well.[2] They met to show the messages to each other; she seemed puzzled.[2] Soon after her death, investigators for the sheriff's department found her fingerprints on the papers and the Scotch tape.[2] They notified the police.\n\nKupcinet had longstanding issues with weight, which started after she began taking diet pills in high school. The pressure to stay thin intensified after Kupcinet arrived in Hollywood, and she soon began abusing diet pills along with other prescription drugs.[2] A Los Angeles Times interviewer, assigned to help Kupcinet promote The Gertrude Berg Show in March 1962, noted her talking exclusively about food and her weight.[4] Kupcinet had also been arrested for shoplifting.[14]\n\n\"It's terribly difficult to keep your head clear in a town where the largest exports are make believe, fantasy and unreal reality. ...it's an emotional industry, buying emotions, moulding emotions, selling emotions. It's a women, a bitch wearing cheap clothes, too much make-up, costume jewellery and rented furs. It's a town where actors pour their life blood into it and then kill themselves because of it.” -- Karyn Kupcinet's diary.",
          "Death": "On November 28, 1963, Kupcinet had dinner with future Lost in Space cast member Mark Goddard and his wife, Marcia Rogers Goddard, at their house on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills.[15] The Goddards expected her to arrive at 6:30 pm, but she showed up in a taxicab an hour late.[citation needed]\n\nThe couple later reported that Kupcinet only toyed with her food during the meal and avoided eating. Marcia told Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies that \"her lips seemed numb. Her voice was funny. She moved her head at odd angles.\"[16] The Goddards also noticed that Kupcinet's pupils were constricted. When Mark confronted Kupcinet about her behavior, she began to cry and put her arm around him.[17] At one point during the meal, she told an unsubstantiated story about a baby that had been abandoned on her doorstep earlier that day.[16] At 8:30 pm, a taxicab arrived to take Kupcinet home, and she promised to telephone the Goddards.[18]\n\nKupcinet apparently went straight home after the dinner. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. Rubin and Hathaway told detectives the three of them watched television, including The Danny Kaye Show, and drank coffee until Kupcinet fell asleep next to them on the couch. She later awoke and went to her room. Rubin and Hathaway either turned the television off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume) and made sure the door was locked behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said that the two men returned to his place and were later joined by Prine, who was also Hathaway's neighbor. The trio watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.[19]\n\nThe Goddards went to Kupcinet's apartment on November 30 after she failed to telephone the couple as promised. Mark later stated that he had a \"funny feeling\" that something was wrong.[2] Upon entering the apartment, the couple found Kupcinet's nude body lying on the couch. Mark initially assumed that she had died from a drug overdose; upon searching the apartment, investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department found prescriptions for Desoxyn, Miltown, Amvicel, and other medications.[2][13] They also found a note written by Kupcinet that reflected in some detail her emotions regarding issues in her life and people she admired.[20]\n\nCoroner Harold Kade concluded that due to the fracture of the hyoid bone in Kupcinet’s throat, she had been strangled. Her death was officially ruled a homicide.[21]\n\nInvestigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department determined that the story Kupcinet had told the Goddards about an abandoned baby on her doorstep, which she had also told Prine by telephone, was false.[16] Neither the sheriff's office nor the Los Angeles Police Department had received a report of a baby found abandoned anywhere in Kupcinet's apartment building on the day before or after the murder.[16]\n\nThe Los Angeles Sheriff's Office told FBI director J. Edgar Hoover that they felt Karyn had been taking a shower immediately preceding her death and had likely answered a fateful knock at the door, given the late hour and fact she opened the door indicated that she knew and trusted that person.[22]",
          "Theories": "When questioned by law enforcement, Andrew Prine reported talking with Kupcinet by phone during the day on Wednesday. Others in the Hollywood community were questioned as well as both Rubin and Hathaway, the two men who had possibly been the last to see her alive, who were friends of Prine's. They were also eventually named as suspects.[23][24][2]\n\nIn 1988, Kupcinet's father published a memoir in which he revealed that he and his wife Essee believed that Prine had nothing to do with their daughter's murder.[25] He was suspicious of a person, still alive when he wrote his memoir, who had no connection to Prine.[25]\n\nAlthough public suspicion fell on Andrew Prine there was a more compelling suspect to Karyn's parents, that evidence pointed to another, actor/producer David Lange (1936-2006). “Essee and I thought it pointed directly at David Lange, who had been a friend of Cookie's. But he was best known in Hollywood as a heavy drinker, a hanger on, and a go-fer. One day he told Cookie he was looking for an apartment and asked her if she knew of any availabilities. She inquired in her building and learned an apartment was vacant. It was on the first floor and he moved in. Cookie lived on the second floor. This juxtaposition became important on the night her body was discovered … Lange's behaviour that night made him suspect. He was in the bedroom of his apartment with a girl friend, who later told police that they 'heard some sought of commotion outside the apartment and it sounded like a lot of people were running up and down stairs'. Lange, she said, ignored the excitement and did not leave the bedroom to see what was happening. She also added that a short time later someone knocked on the door. He answered it, she said, 'and came right back to the bedroom and made no comment.' Police suspect the unidentified caller had informed him of Karyn's death, but he chose not to appear on the scene because he already knew what had happened. That enabled him to stay clear of the authorities.[27]\n\n“If that behaviour was suspect, there also was a 'confession.'” Irv Kupcinet continued, “The police report includes a statement from a friend of Lange who reported that he told her that he was the person who killed Karyn. Essee and I pressed the sheriff's police to pursue such a revealing statement, but their response was that they had tried with no success because Lange by this time had moved into the house of his sister, Hope, and she had retained attorneys who refused to let him answer any questions... The police subjected Lange to a polygraph test, which proved inconclusive. But no follow-up was done.” [28]\n\nKupcinet's death was first mentioned in connection with the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1967 by researcher Penn Jones Jr. in the self-published book Forgive My Grief II.[28] Jones cited an Associated Press wire service story about an unidentified woman who placed a phone call from the vicinity of Oxnard, California, about fifty miles northwest of Los Angeles, twenty minutes before the assassination occurred in Dallas, Texas, claiming this woman was Kupcinet.\n\nJones alleged that \"Karyn Kupcinet\" had attempted to warn someone of the impending assassination after being given this information by her father Irv, who himself had allegedly been given advance notice by Jack Ruby, the Dallas nightclub owner who fatally shot Kennedy's accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Jones speculated that Irv may have met Ruby in Chicago in the 1940s.[20] Jones speculated Karyn had been murdered by representatives of the Italian-American Mafia as a message to her father to remain silent about why Kennedy and Oswald had been shot.[29]\n\nIrv Kupcinet denied that he or his daughter had prior knowledge of the assassination or of Oswald's death. This was supported by Kupcinet's friends, including Prine, actor Earl Holliman, and Holliman's then-girlfriend, all of whom traveled to Palm Springs with Karyn on November 22. Kupcinet reportedly seemed upset about media coverage of the shootings while in Palm Springs.[20] She did not reveal any foreknowledge of the events.[20]\n\nIn 2013, the Ventura County Star commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination with a long article about the unknown woman who had formed the basis of Penn Jones' conspiracy theory.[30] Citing FBI documents that were declassified decades after the assassination, the Star claimed that two telephone operators with General Telephone Company who listened to the unknown woman gave the FBI a description of her voice.[30] FBI agents questioned the two operators several hours after the assassination.[30] Their description of the woman's voice did not match Kupcinet's, especially in regard to her age.[30] The Star added that the two operators believed the woman on the phone was \"mentally disturbed\".[30]\n\nRegarding Irv Kupcinet's alleged connection to Jack Ruby, the Warren Commission did not find any proof that Irv had interacted with Ruby in Chicago before 1947, when Ruby moved from Chicago to Dallas.[31] The Commission questioned many Chicagoans who had interacted with Ruby.[31] None of them had prior knowledge that he was going to shoot Oswald.[31]\n\nKaryn's death occurred six days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as rumours and theories were swirling around possible Mafia involvement, that the Chicago syndicate and Sam Giancana (1908-1975) were part of it due to the Kennedy administration's tough stance on organised crime. Irv Kupcinet had been friends with Sam Giancana, Tony Accardo (1906-1992) and other Mafia dons for decades; as such, it isn't surprising that conspiracy theories surfaced linking the two events. It didn't help matters that Kupcinet turned up at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office with old friend, Mafia lawyer and \"fixer\" Sidney Korshak (1907-1996) representing him, also handling the release of his daughter's remains for burial. It undoubtedly raised law enforcement eyebrows as it did conspiracy theorists; Korshak's other clients included Al Capone - Sam Giancana - Moe Dalitz (Los Vegas syndicate head) and Jimmy Hoffa. It created a frenzy of speculation around Karyn's death and drew them into silly conspiracy theories to kill JFK which Irv Kupcinet hated, not least due to his longstanding friendship with the Kennedy family.[11][2][33]",
          "Media attention": "In the early 1990s, during the production and subsequent release of Oliver Stone's film JFK, Irv Kupcinet attacked the movie and the conspiracy theories surrounding it.[20] When the film's box-office success led to a wave of media attention about Kennedy conspiracy theories, NBC's Today program broadcast a list of mysterious deaths, including that of Karyn Kupcinet. Irv responded to the Today broadcast in his column in the Chicago Sun-Times of February 9, 1992:\n\nThe NBC Today Show on Friday [February 7] carried a list of people who died violently in 1963 shortly after the death of President John F. Kennedy and may have had some link to the assassination. The first name on the list was Karyn Kupcinet, my daughter. That is an atrocious outrage. She did die violently in a Hollywood murder case still unsolved. That same list was published in a book years ago with no justification or verification. The book left the impression that some on the list may have been killed to silence them because of knowledge of the assassination. Nothing could be further from the truth in my daughter's case. The list apparently has developed a life of its own and for Today to repeat the calumny is reprehensible. Karyn no longer can suffer pain by such an inexcusable mention, but her parents and her brother Jerry can.[20]\n\nOn September 30, 1999, an episode of E! True Hollywood Story, titled \"Death of a Dream: Karyn Kupcinet\", detailed Kupcinet's life and theories regarding her death.[34]",
          "Legacy": "Irv and Essee Kupcinet established a playhouse at Shimer College in honor of their daughter.[35] In 1971, Irv Kupcinet and his wife also founded the Karyn Kupcinet International School for Science, a summer research internships program at the Weizmann Institute of Science.[36]\n\nIn 2007, Kupcinet's niece, actress Kari Kupcinet-Kriser, and Washburn University professor Paul Fecteau, began work on a book about Kupcinet's unsolved murder and diaries.[37] However the project came to nothing and was abandoned.",

          "Lead": "James Robert Leavelle (August 23, 1920 – August 29, 2019) was a Dallas Police Department homicide detective who, on November 24, 1963, was escorting Lee Harvey Oswald through the basement of Dallas Police headquarters when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Leavelle prominently was noted in films and photographs—including one that won a Pulitzer Prize—taken just as Ruby shot Oswald.[1][2]",
          "Early life and military service": "James R. Leavelle was born and raised in Red River County, Texas. In 1937, Leavelle joined the Civilian Conservation Corps.[3] Following graduation from high school, Leavelle joined the United States Navy in 1939, during World War II and served as a sailor on board the USS Whitney; he was on board the ship during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.[4][5]\n\nIn April 1942, the Whitney left Pearl Harbor and headed for the South Pacific Ocean to support operations there. After being knocked down and seriously injured by a rogue wave, he was evacuated to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital near Oakland, California. In the hospital, he met nurse Taimi Sanelma Trast, his wife-to-be. Around the same time, Leavelle left on a medical discharge to take a civilian supply job with the Army Air Force in Southern California.",
          "Police career": "After the war ended, Leavelle worked as an auditor for the Veterans Administration until 1950.[3] Leavelle began a career as a homicide detective in the Dallas Police Department in April 1950 and retired in April 1975.[6][7]",
          "November 1963 and aftermath": "On November 22, 1963, after Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested at the Texas Theatre for the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy and the murder of Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit, Leavelle told Tippit murder witnesses Ted Callaway and Sam Guinyard while they were waiting to view Oswald in a line-up, \"We want to be sure, we want to try to wrap him up real tight on killing this officer. We think he is the same one that shot the President. But if we can wrap him up tight on killing this officer, we have got him.\"[8]\n\nOn November 24, Oswald was handcuffed between Leavelle and fellow detective L. C. Graves as he was being led through the basement of the Dallas Police Headquarters to an armored car that was to take him from the city jail to the county jail. Jack Ruby emerged from the crowd and shot and mortally wounded Oswald at point-blank range. Leavelle would later state that when Ruby fired and Oswald screamed \"Oh!\" and slumped to the floor, \"I had to go down with him because I was handcuffed to him. ...Graves had grabbed his gun and was wrestling the gun away from him.\"[9] Leavelle and Graves carried Oswald into the basement level jail office where Oswald was attended by Frederick Bieberdorf, a medical student on duty. Oswald was placed onto an ambulance to be driven to Parkland Memorial Hospital, the same hospital where President Kennedy had died two days earlier. Leavelle and Graves, along with Bieberdorf, rode in the ambulance.[10] Oswald died at Parkland.\n\nLeavelle gave interviews in which he said he saw Ruby emerge with the gun and that he had jerked Oswald by his trousers to pull him behind him when the shot was fired. He noted Graves wrestling with Ruby and that Ruby was \"still trying to snap the pistol\". He also said he tried to talk to Oswald on the floor of the jail office but that Oswald never answered him. He also said he had known Ruby before and \"had recognized him\" as he emerged from the crowd. It was Leavelle who transferred Ruby to the county jail on November 25.\n\nLeavelle took a statement from Texas School Book Depository employee Victoria Adams on February 17, 1964. Adams had only moved into an apartment the day before Leavelle knocked on her door, and she had not yet notified anyone with a change of address. When asked why he needed to talk with her since she had already given her testimony to the Dallas Police, he responded, \"Oh, the records were all burned in a fire we had and we have to interview everyone again.\" No evidence of a fire at the DPD has been uncovered. When asked by researcher Barry Ernest, Leavelle told him that it was during preparations for Ruby's trial.[11]\n\nOn March 25, 1964, Leavelle provided testimony to Warren Commission assistant counsel Leon Hubert.[12] He provided additional testimony to assistant counsel Joseph Ball on April 7. Leavelle testified that, \"at the time I didn't realize there was any connection between Oswald and the shooting of Tippit or the one that they had arrested in the Texas Theatre for the killing of Tippit and the Presidential assassination. I thought it was two different things altogether. So, I proceeded back to the office to work on that end of it, checking with the captain, and they was tied up with the Presidential assassination, and not until we got there did I realize some few minutes later on, when talking to some of the people of the Texas Book Depository, did we realize Oswald could very well be the same one who assassinated the President.\" He also noted that it was not normal procedure for police officers to join in on line-ups. Leavelle thought that other prisoners would harm Oswald.[13]\n\nLeavelle testified that the first time he had ever sat in on an interrogation with Oswald was on November 24, 1963. When Ball asked Leavelle if he had ever spoken to Oswald before this interrogation, he stated, \"No, I had never talked to him before\". Leavelle then stated during his testimony that \"the only time I had connections with Oswald was this Sunday morning [November 24, 1963]. I never had [the] occasion... to talk with him at any time...\" He used \"I do not recall\" thirty times in two testimony sessions and \"I don't remember\" nine times, in regards to the events of November 1963.[13]\n\nHe also recalled Oswald protesting about the line-up with him in a T-shirt, stating that \"he was raising Cain about being up there with a T-shirt and wouldn't be quiet...He said it wasn't fair...he went on all the time.\" When Ball asked, \"You took part in the investigation, did you not, as a member of the Dallas Police Department?\", Leavelle replied, \"A minor part you might say. I didn't have much to do with Oswald, myself.\"[13]\n\nThe tan suit that Leavelle wore on November 24, 1963, is on display at the Sixth Floor Museum.[14]\n\nLeavelle supported the official conclusion that Oswald acted alone and rejected conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination.[4][15][16]",
          "Later life and death": "In later interviews, Leavelle said that he interrogated Oswald regarding the Tippit murder on November 22. He said that he joked with Oswald before the transfer, saying \"Lee, if anybody shoots at you, I hope they're as good a shot as you are,\" meaning that the person would hit Oswald instead of Leavelle. Oswald smiled and said, \"You're being melodramatic. Nobody's going to shoot at me.\"[4][17]\n\nIn December 1992, while demonstrating at his home in Garland, Texas,[18] how L. C. Graves grabbed Ruby's gun in an attempt to stop him from firing, Leavelle accidentally shot researcher and photographer Bob Porter in the arm, using the same model gun Ruby had used. Porter recovered at Parkland Hospital.[18]\n\nIn an interview with author Joseph McBride, Leavelle said in regards to how his department had reacted to the president's assassination, \"...as the old saying goes back then, 'it was no different than a south Dallas nigger killing'. When you get right down to it – because it was just another murder inside the city limits of Dallas that we could handle. It was just another murder to me. I've handled hundreds of them. So it wasn't no big deal.\" Leavelle said in regards to the death of Tippit, \"What some people don't realize is that when a police officer gets killed, that takes precedence over the shooting of the president, because that's close to home.\"[19]\n\nRobert N. McClelland, who treated Kennedy and Oswald at Parkland Hospital, said that while at Parkland, Leavelle, who was waiting outside the hospital room, told him that after Oswald was shot, he claimed to have \"leaned over Oswald and said, 'Son, you're hurt real bad. Do you wanna say anything?' He looked at me for a second. He waited like he was thinking. Then he shook his head back and forth just as wide as he could. Then he closed his eyes.\"[20] Leavelle refuted the claim.[21]\n\nIn November 2011, Leavelle lost an eye after a serious fall, after which he wore a glass eye.[22]\n\nIn 2013, the Dallas Police Department's Detective of the Year Award was named in Leavelle's honor.[7]\n\nLeavelle's wife Taimi died in October 2014. Leavelle died from a heart attack following hip surgery on August 29, 2019, aged 99.[23][24][25]\n\n^ \"Officer handcuffed to Oswald can't escape photo\". NBC News.

          "Lead": "Ilona Marita Lorenz (18 August 1939 – 31 August 2019) was a German woman who had an affair with Fidel Castro in 1959 and in January 1960 was involved in an assassination attempt by the CIA on Castro's life.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, she testified about the John F. Kennedy assassination, stating that she was involved with a group of anti-Cuban militants, including Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt of CIA and Watergate infamy, shortly before the assassination.",
          "Early life": "She was born Ilona Marita Lorenz in Bremen, the daughter of Alice June (née Lofland) and Heinrich Lorenz. She had a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Joachim and Manfred \"Philip\".[2] Her father, a wealthy German navy captain, became commander of a fleet of U-boats when Germany invaded Poland two weeks after Marita was born and was subsequently taken prisoner after his ship was captured; he was interned in a POW camp in England.[2] Her mother, who was born in Delaware, was an actress and dancer who performed under the stage name June Paget.[3] Earlier in the war she had been recruited for the French underground by British intelligence after she aided in the rescue of a French soldier and British pilot.[2] Accused of helping forced laborers in Bremen escape, Marita and her mother were incarcerated in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944.[2]\n\nAfter liberation by the allies, the Lorenz family moved to Bremerhaven. Alice began working for U.S. Army intelligence, and then the OSS, the U.S. wartime foreign intelligence agency predating the CIA.[2]\n\nWhen Marita was seven years old, she was raped by an American soldier, and testified against him in the trial that followed. Journalist Ann Louise Bardach wrote that \"[m]any close to Lorenz say\" these events \"set in motion a lifelong pattern of violence and revenge in her relationships with men.\"[2]\n\nThe Lorenz family moved to the United States in 1950, and Heinrich began work as captain of various luxury ocean liners. During this time, Alice's work in the intelligence community deepened, working alternatively with both U.S. Army intelligence and the Pentagon.[2] Marita's sister Valerie described her mother's work: \"I was never sure who [she] was working for, except I knew she worked in intelligence with high security clearance. She didn’t confide in me, but she was very close with Marita.\"[2]",
          "Castro and Pérez Jiménez": "In February 1959, weeks after the conclusion of the Cuban Revolution, Lorenz arrived in Havana with her father on board the MS Berlin.[4] Fidel Castro and his men visited the ship and Castro took a liking to Lorenz. After dinner, the Berlin set sail for New York. Lorenz disembarked in Manhattan, where she would be living with her brother Joachim, a student at Columbia University.[5] A few days after she arrived, Castro called Lorenz—she had given him Joachim's home number on a matchbox before parting ways—and said he was sending a plane to fly her back to Cuba. A jeep picked Lorenz up at the other end and drove her to the Havana Hilton, which Castro had repurposed as his base of operations. She claims then to have lived with Castro for several months, engaging in a sexual relationship. There are unconfirmed theories about whether she became pregnant with his child during this time, but no child was born.\n\nShe left the island and joined anti-Castro activists in Florida. Her later testimony named Francisco Fiorini as the CIA agent who recruited her to assassinate Castro, and that this was an alias for Frank Fiorini Sturgis. She received poison pills that she was to put in Castro's food. Back in Cuba in 1960, she did not deliver the pills but told Castro about the plot, claiming that she still loved him.[6] She left the island and visited Castro one last time in 1981.\n\nAccording to Lorenz, in March 1961 she met deposed Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, introduced to her as \"General Diaz\", at a residence in Miami Beach, Florida while working as a courier for the International Anti-Communist Brigade.[7] She said she was to collect a $200,000 contribution from Pérez Jiménez for her group.[7] Lorenz said: \"He chased me around for six weeks.\"[7]\n\nLorenz claimed that Castro and Pérez Jiménez each fathered a child with her.[7]\n\nIn August 1963, a paternity suit Lorenz filed against Pérez Jiménez briefly held up his extradition to Venezuela.[8][9] She claimed to have been with Frank Sturgis at a meeting with the CIA head in Miami which also included E. Howard Hunt, which Frank stated was for planning right before the JFK assassination.",
          "JFK conspiracy allegations": "In 1977, Lorenz told Paul Meskil of the New York Daily News that she met Lee Harvey Oswald in the fall of 1963 at an Operation 40 safe house in the Little Havana section of Miami.[10] According to Lorenz, she met him again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 in the house of Orlando Bosch, with Frank Sturgis, Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz, and two other Cubans present.[10] She said the men studied Dallas street maps and that she suspected that they were planning on raiding an arsenal.[10] Lorenz stated that she joined the men traveling to Dallas in two cars and carrying \"rifles and scopes\", but flew back to Miami the day after they arrived.[10] In response to her allegations, Sturgis said he did not recall ever meeting Oswald and reiterated his previous denials of being involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.[10] In an interview with Steve Dunleavy of the New York Post, he said that he believed communist agents had pressured Lorenz into making the accusations against him.[11]\n\nLorenz testified about this Kennedy assassination plot before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Her testimony was investigated by the political committee and said to be unreliable.[12]\n\nIn February 1985, attorney Mark Lane read a deposition that Lorenz provided in E. Howard Hunt's libel suit against the Liberty Lobby's tabloid, The Spotlight.[13] Lorenz lived in New York City at the time, however, Lane read the deposition in court stating that Lorenz was \"afraid to come to Miami\".[13] The deposition reiterated allegations similar to those she provided to the HSCA.[13] Lorenz said she met Oswald in Miami in the early 1960s, and that in November 1963 Sturgis asked her to come to Dallas with him and Oswald to act as a decoy.[13] Her statement said that she, Oswald, and seven anti-Castro Cubans transported weapons to Dallas in two cars shortly before 22 November 1963.[13] Lorenz claimed that Hunt came to their Dallas motel room and provided Sturgis with an envelope filled with cash.[14] According to one account, this testimony became the \"centerpiece\" for Lane's 1991 book Plausible Denial.[7]\n\nIn 1993, Lorenz was interviewed by Vanity Fair writer Ann Louise Bardach who described her as \"a patron saint of conspiracy buffs\".[7] Bardach wrote, \"at least half of her story is readily documented by the accounts of others and FBI memorandum, the other half lacks any corroboration, at times, flies in the face of existing evidence.\"[7]",
          "Work for the FBI": "In 1970, she married the manager of an apartment building in New York. The two worked for the FBI spying on Eastern Bloc UN diplomats living in the building.[6]",
          "Books and films": "With Ted Schwarz, Lorenz's first autobiography, Marita: One Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy, was published in 1993 by Thunder's Mouth Press.[15] Kirkus Reviews described the book as \"the wild—if nearly incredible—adventures of a new Jane Bond\".[16] Publishers Weekly wrote: \"Like other sensational conspiracy stories, this one presses the limits of credibility, but its very outrageousness gives it weight.\"[15] Her second autobiography Lieber Fidel – Mein Leben, meine Liebe, mein Verrat (ISBN 3471780793) appeared in 2001.\n\nLorenz's story was the inspiration for Jack Bender's 1999 TV film My Little Assassin.[17] Gabrielle Anwar portrayed Lorenz in the film and her mother Alice was portrayed by Jill Clayburgh.[17] She is also the subject of a 2000 German documentary film Lieber Fidel – Maritas Geschichte (\"Dear Fidel – Marita's Story\").[18][19]\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that she would be played by Jennifer Lawrence in the upcoming biographical film Marita,[20] which is based on Lorenz's memoir, Marita: The Spy Who Loved Castro.[21] As of 2022, the film is still listed as 'in development'.[22]",
          "Personal life": "Lorenz lived in Baltimore, Maryland.[7]\n\nMonica Mercedes Pérez Jiménez, the daughter she had with Marcos Pérez Jiménez (former President of Venezuela), is married to one of the sons of Orlando Letelier.[23]\n\n^ Roberts, Sam (5 September 2019). \"Marita Lorenz, Who Told Tales of Castro and Kennedy, Dies at 80\".

          "Lead": "Carlos Joseph Marcello[1] (Sicilian Italian);[Mor-sel-lo] born Calogero Minacore [kaˈlɔːdʒero minaˈkɔːre]; February 6, 1910 – March 3, 1993) was an Italian-American crime boss of the New Orleans crime family from 1947 to 1983.\n\nAside from his role in the American Mafia, he is also notorious for the reason that G. Robert Blakey and others have alleged that Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante Jr., and Sam Giancana conspired in the 1963 assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in retaliation for federal investigations and prosecutions that threatened both the power and the multibillion-dollar profits of organized crime.[2][3]",
          "Early life": "Marcello was born on February 6, 1910, to Sicilian immigrants Giuseppe and Luigia Minacore, in Tunis, French Tunisia.[4] With his family, Marcello immigrated to the United States in 1911 and settled in a decaying plantation house near Metairie in Jefferson Parish, a suburb of New Orleans. His father adopted a different family name to avoid confusion with his supervisor on the sugar plantation where he had started work. His overseer, also Minacore, chose the appellation Marcello.[5] The family changed all their other names, and Calogero Minacore became Carlos Joseph Marcello. He had eight siblings: Peter, Rose, Mary, Pascal, Vincent, Joseph Jr., Anthony and Salvador Marcello.\n\nYoung Marcello turned to petty crime in the French Quarter. He was later imprisoned for masterminding a crew of teenage gangsters who carried out armed robberies in the small towns surrounding New Orleans. At the time, local newspapers compared him to the character of Fagin from Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist. This conviction was later overturned. However, the following year he was convicted of assault and robbery and was sentenced to the Louisiana State Penitentiary in West Feliciana Parish for nine years. He was released after five years.\n\nIn 1938, Marcello was arrested and charged with the sale of more than 10 kg (23 pounds) of marijuana. Despite receiving another lengthy prison sentence and a $76,830 fine, Marcello served less than ten months and only paid a $400 fine thanks to a deal cut with former Governor Huey Long.[citation needed] On his release from prison, Marcello became associated with Frank Costello, the leader of the Genovese crime family, in New York City. At the time, Costello was involved in transporting illegal slot machines from New York City to New Orleans. Marcello provided the muscle and arranged for the machines to be placed in local businesses.",
          "Louisiana crime boss": "By the end of 1947, Marcello had taken control of Louisiana's illegal gambling network. He had also joined forces with Genovese crime family associate Meyer Lansky in order to skim money from some of the most important casinos in the New Orleans area shortly after becoming associated with the Todaro family through marriage. According to former members of the Chicago Outfit, Marcello was also assigned a cut of the money skimmed from Las Vegas casinos, in exchange for providing \"muscle\" in Florida real estate deals. By this time, Marcello had been selected as \"The Godfather\" of the New Orleans Mafia, by the family's capos and with the approval of The Commission after the deportation of his predecessor, Sylvestro Carolla, to Sicily. He held this position for the next thirty years. In a 1975 extortion trial, two witnesses described Marcello as \"The Godfather\" of the New Orleans crime syndicate.[6]\n\nMarcello appeared before the U.S. Senate's Kefauver Committee on organized crime on January 25, 1951. He pleaded the Fifth Amendment 152 times. The Committee called Marcello \"one of the worst criminals in the country\".[7]\n\nMarcello continued the family's long-standing tradition of fierce independence from interference by mafiosi in other areas. He enacted a policy that forbade mafiosi from other families from visiting Louisiana without first asking permission.\n\nOn March 24, 1959, Marcello appeared before the United States Senate's McClellan Committee investigating organized crime. Serving as Chief Counsel to the committee was Robert F. Kennedy; his brother, Senator John F. Kennedy, was a member of the committee. In response to committee questioning, Marcello invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer any questions relating to his background, activities, and associates. From then on, Marcello became an avowed enemy of the Kennedys.[2]\n\nThe New Orleans crime family frequently met at Mosca's Italian restaurant in the New Orleans suburb of Avondale, in a building which Marcello had owned.[8]",
          "Prosecution": "On April 4, 1961, the U.S. Justice Department, under the direction of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, apprehended Marcello as he made what he assumed was a routine visit to the immigration authorities in New Orleans, then deported him to Guatemala.[9][10] Two months later, he was back in New Orleans. Thereafter, he successfully fought efforts by the government to deport him.[11][12] His immigration lawyer was Jack Wasserman.\n\nIn November 1963, Marcello was tried for \"conspiracy to defraud the United States government by obtaining a false Guatemalan birth certificate\" and \"conspiracy to obstruct the United States government in the exercise of its right to deport Carlos Marcello\". He was acquitted later that month on both charges. However, in October 1964, Marcello was charged with \"conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing a juror [Rudolph Heitler] and seeking the murder of a government witness [Carl Noll]\". Marcello's attorney admitted Heitler had been bribed but said that there was no evidence to connect the bribe with Marcello. Noll refused to testify against Marcello in the case. Marcello was acquitted of both charges.[13]\n\nIn September 1966, 13 members of the New York, Louisiana and Florida crime families were arrested for \"consorting with known criminals\" at the La Stella Restaurant in Queens, New York. However, the charges were later dropped. Returning to New Orleans a few days later, Marcello was arrested for assaulting an FBI agent. His first trial resulted in a hung jury, but he was retried and convicted. He was sentenced to two years but served less than six months.[14]\n\nIn 1981, Marcello, Aubrey W. Young (a former aide to Governor John J. McKeithen), Charles E. Roemer, II (former commissioner of administration to Governor Edwin Edwards), and two other men were indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans with conspiracy, racketeering, and mail and wire fraud in a scheme to bribe state officials to give the five men multimillion-dollar insurance contracts.[15] The charges were the result of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe known as BriLab.[16] U.S. District Judge Morey Sear allowed the admission of secretly-recorded conversations that he said demonstrated corruption at the highest levels of state government.[17] Marcello and Roemer were convicted, but Young and the two others were acquitted.[18]",
          "Kennedy assassination": "In its 1978 investigation of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said that it recognized Jack Ruby's murder of Lee Harvey Oswald as a primary reason to suspect organized crime as possibly having involvement in the assassination.[19] In its investigation, the HSCA noted the presence of \"credible associations relating both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby to figures having a relationship, albeit tenuous, with Marcello's crime family or organization\".[19] Their report stated: \"The committee found that Marcello had the motive, means and opportunity to have President John F. Kennedy assassinated, though it was unable to establish direct evidence of Marcello's complicity\".[19]\n\nIn their book, Fatal Hour: The Assassination of President Kennedy By Organized Crime, authors Richard N. Billings and G. Robert Blakey (who was chief counsel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations and previously Special Attorney in the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy) conclude that President Kennedy's murder was planned and carried out by Marcello and conspirators. They claim that their book lays out evidence that has been corroborated by additional sources and official records released in subsequent years.[3]\n\nIn his 1989 book, Mafia Kingfish: Carlos Marcello and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, author John H. Davis implicates Marcello in the assassination of Kennedy.[20] According to Davis, Oswald and Ruby had \"strong ties\" to Marcello.[20][21]\n\nIn his 1994 autobiography Mob Lawyer, attorney Frank Ragano says that he relayed a message in 1963 from Teamsters Union leader Jimmy Hoffa to Marcello and Santo Trafficante, the Mafia boss of Florida, urging the two Mafia bosses to kill Kennedy.[22][23] Ragano later claimed that four days before Trafficante died, the mob boss described to Ragano how he and Marcello organized the murder of President Kennedy.[2]\n\nIn his 2013 book The Hidden History of the JFK Assassination, Lamar Waldron claimed that Marcello masterminded the assassination of Kennedy.[24] According to Waldron, Marcello admitted his involvement to two other inmates during a fit of rage in the prison yard at the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, Texas.[24] In his book, Waldron also presented the account of Marcello's prison cellmate, Jack Van Laningham, who claimed in 1985 that Marcello bragged to him that he had masterminded the Kennedy assassination, while planting red herrings to confuse the press and embarrass the FBI and CIA into suppressing evidence.[2] According to Waldron, Marcello arranged for two hit men to carry out the assassination after entering the United States from Canada and Europe, while setting up Oswald as the fall guy and ordering the subsequent murder of various conspirators and witnesses who risked turning informants, including mobsters Johnny Roselli and Sam Giancana.[25]\n\nAccording to criminal underworld investigator and author Charles Brandt, \"While in Texarkana Federal prison, during a two-day period in which Marcello was having blood pressure problems and was sent to the prison hospital, Marcello spoke to medical attendants as if they were members of his crime family. On three occasions he told them he had just met in New York with [Genovese capo Tony] 'Provenzano' and they would soon be celebrating, because they were 'going to get that smiling m.f. Kennedy in Dallas\".[26]",
          "Personal life": "In 1936, Marcello married Jacqueline Todaro, the niece of senior New Orleans Mafioso Frank Todaro. They had four children, Louise Hampton, Joseph C. Marcello, Florence Black and Jacqueline Dugas.[27]",
          "Death": "Early in 1989, Marcello suffered a series of strokes. In July, in a surprise move, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out his BriLab conviction. One judge denied this reversal, but his decision in turn was overruled. In October, after having served six years and six months of his sentence, Marcello was released. Carlos Marcello died on March 2, 1993.[12]",
          "In popular culture": "In Bryce Zabel's 2014 novel Surrounded by Enemies: A Breakpoint Novel, in an alternative universe where President Kennedy survived the assassination, but agent Clint Hill and Texas Governor John Connally were killed, President Kennedy talked to his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, discussing suspects, including Marcello. Codenamed \"New Orleans\", Marcello was said to have motive and resources to carry out the attack.[citation needed]\nSal Marcano, the chief antagonist of Mafia III is loosely based on Carlos Marcello.\nHe is mentioned two times in Martin Scorsese's crime film The Irishman, which stars Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran, who says: \"But Bobby also goes after Giancana, Marcello, Trafficante, and all the other guys who put his brother in the White House in the first place\". During the Frank Sheeran Appreciation Night, Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno tells Russell Bufalino (referring to Jimmy Hoffa) \"Because his guys are holding 'em back loans on Carlos's new hotel in New Orleans\".\nHe appears in Cormac McCarthy's novel The Passenger, observed in a New Orleans restaurant by protagonist Bobby Western and a detective Western has befriended.\nIn Greg Iles' trilogy \"Nachez Burning\", Marcello is repeatedly referred to as the mastermind behind both JFK's assassination and a plan to also shoot Robert Kennedy when he became a presidential candidate in 1968.\nMarcello plays a significant role in James Ellroy's novel American Tabloid and its sequel The Cold Six Thousand, alongside other mafiosi including Sam Giancana, Santo Trafficante, Johnny Roselli and Hershel Ryskind. In the former novel, we read a fictionalized version of Marcello's deportation to Guatemala. More broadly, the novels cover fictionalised accounts of the Bay of Pigs, the election and assassination of J.F. Kennedy, and the assassinations of R.F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. In Elloy's fiction, these have substantial mafia involvement.\n\nIn Bryce Zabel's 2014 novel Surrounded by Enemies: A Breakpoint Novel, in an alternative universe where President Kennedy survived the assassination, but agent Clint Hill and Texas Governor John Connally were killed, President Kennedy talked to his brother Attorney General Robert F.

          "Lead": "Robert Nelson McClelland (November 20, 1929 – September 10, 2019) was an American surgeon. On November 22, 1963, he worked unsuccessfully to save the life of U.S. President John F. Kennedy after he was fatally shot, and two days later, the life of Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.",
          "Early life and education": "Robert Nelson McClelland was born on November 20, 1929, in Gilmer, Texas. His father, Robert, was a butcher, and his mother, Verna McClelland née Nelson, worked for a federal relief agency.[1] He graduated from University of Texas at Austin in 1950 and University of Texas Medical Branch in 1954.[2]",
          "Career": "McClelland was a medical officer in the United States Air Force for two years[1] and was stationed overseas in Germany for a time. After completing a residency at Parkland Memorial Hospital, he was hired as a faculty member at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. His specialty was in surgery related to the liver, pancreas, and biliary tract.[3]\n\nIn 1974, McClelland created and was the first editor for the very successful Selected Readings in General Surgery, aiming to present to students and surgeons the most useful of medical-journal articles, now published by the American College of Surgeons.[3][2][4] After 45 years on the faculty at Southwestern Medical Center, McClelland retired in August 2007. In September 2007, he was appointed Professor Emeritus of Surgery at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, remaining involved in medical-student education.[5]",
          "Assassination of John F. Kennedy and aftermath": "On November 22, 1963, McClelland was working at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, when President John F. Kennedy was brought in grievously injured. Despite the efforts of the three attending surgeons, McClelland, Malcolm Perry, and Charles R. Baxter,[6] he died shortly after arriving.[2] McClelland supported the idea that Kennedy had been shot from the front, thus the idea that there was a second gunman.[6] McClelland was called to testify to the Warren Commission, he described the \"posterior portion of the skull\" as \"extremely blasted\". He said the wound was such that \"you could actually look down into the skull cavity itself and see probably a third or so, at least, of the brain tissue\".[7]\n\nTwo days later, McClelland saw on the news that Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald had been shot. McClelland immediately went back to the hospital. Along with Tom Shires, McClelland worked unsuccessfully to save Oswald's life, as he was pronounced dead two hours after being shot.[2] McClelland preserved his blood-stained shirt from attempting to save President Kennedy for the rest of his life.[6]",
          "Personal life and death": "McClelland married Connie Logan in May 1958. She was the head nurse at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and the two also attended the same church.[6] They had two daughters and a son.[1] McClelland enjoyed reading, and insisted on having a bookcase in every room of his house.[6]\n\nMcClelland died from kidney failure on September 10, 2019, at an assisted living facility in Dallas. He was 89.[1]",
          "Honors": "In 1990, McClelland became the namesake for the Parkland Surgical Society's Robert N. McClelland Lectureship.[8]\n\n^\na b c d Sandomir, Richard (September 24, 2019). \"Dr. Robert McClelland, Who Tried to Save President Kennedy, Dies at 89\". The New York Times.

          "Lead": "Godfrey T. McHugh (September 30, 1911 – July 5, 1997) was a United States Air Force general and served as military aide to President John F. Kennedy.",
          "Early years": "McHugh was born in Brussels, Belgium, to American parents. He received a baccalaureate in science and languages from the University of Paris in 1929.\n\nHe was an oil production supervisor for the West Texas Production Company in Fort Worth, Texas from 1938 to 1942.\n\nHe dated Jacqueline Bouvier (who later married John F. Kennedy and became First Lady of the United States).[1]",
          "Military career": "After the U.S. entered World War II, McHugh joined the U.S. Army Air Forces as a captain on January 31, 1942, and received pilot training. From February 1942 to 1943 he was a planning officer with the Air War Plans Division of the War Department General Staff. From 1943 to 1946 was executive of the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board assigned to General H.H. Arnold, commanding general U.S. Army Air Forces. He also served in both the European and Pacific Theaters with the Scientific Advisory Board. He was with the Army General Staff Intelligence Foreign Liaison Office for a year, graduated from the Army General Staff Strategic Military School in 1947. Then he became assistant executive and senior aide to General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, chief of staff, U.S. Air Force, from 1948 to 1953. McHugh attended the National War College from 1953 to 1954. During World War II, he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was stationed in the European and Pacific Theater. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his wartime service.[2]",
          "Kennedy Administration": "He became Air Force Aide to President Kennedy and was promoted to Brigadier General in 1961. As military aide to the President, his duties included supervising Air Force One. He very often rode in the middle of the front seat of the Presidential State Car while transporting the President. While he was in Dallas, Texas during the John F. Kennedy assassination, McHugh was moved farther back in the motorcade that day rather than riding in the President's car. He was present at Parkland Memorial Hospital as doctors attempted to save the President’s life.\n\nAfter Kennedy's death, McHugh stood guard by Kennedy's body on Air Force One as the President's body was returned to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn a 1978 oral history interview that McHugh gave to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library (that was withheld from the public until 2009), McHugh provided detailed statements that once Kennedy's body was back on-board Air Force One he did not know that Lyndon Johnson was also on board. Due to safety concerns that there was a conspiracy, Jacqueline Kennedy's repeated requests, and the fact that the plane's interior cabin was quite warm, McHugh had requested that the plane take off. When the plane still had not taken off, McHugh went forward to again ask pilot James Swindal why the plane had not taken off and he was told that Johnson did not want the plane to take off yet. McHugh went to find Johnson and he soon found Johnson in a bathroom with Johnson saying repeatedly, \"They're going to get us all. It's a plot. It's a plot. It's going to get us all.\" According to the General, Johnson \"was hysterical, sitting down on the john there alone in this thing.\"[3] In a documented interview the previous week in 1978 McHugh had also stated to the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigator Mark Flanagan the same basic account of what he witnessed.[4]",
          "Jordan Marsh incident": "In the summer of 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy was at the Kennedy family compound in Massachusetts while she was pregnant. Air Force personnel became concerned that if Mrs. Kennedy were to deliver the child at the Otis Air Force Base hospital, that the maternity ward furniture would be unsatisfactory for the newborn child of the President and First Lady. The Air Force then spent $5,000.00 ($44,000 in 2021) of taxpayer money at Jordan Marsh & Company to purchase new furniture,[5] and allowed media photographs of a U.S. Navy aide standing next to the purchase. After the photos made their way into the Washington Post, an irate President Kennedy telephoned McHugh and ordered him to have the furniture returned. Kennedy's profanity-laden phone call with McHugh is now public.[6]",
          "Later years": "McHugh married Lillian Triplett Fall in 1967. The couple retired to Palm Beach, Florida in 1986.\n\nGeneral McHugh died in Palm Beach in 1997 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[7]",

After serving in World War II as a Marine officer in the Pacific War, where he was both injured and decorated, he led the United World Federalists in the years after the war. Around 1949, he began working for the CIA, where he became a high-level operative, retiring in 1977. After retiring from intelligence work in 1977, Meyer wrote as a columnist and book author.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1958, Meyer was married to Mary Pinchot, who was later romantically linked to President John F. Kennedy. Her murder in 1964, eleven months after Kennedy's assassination, remains unresolved.[1]",
          "Early life": "Meyer was the son of a wealthy New York family.[2] His father, Cord Meyer III, was a diplomat and real estate developer; his mother, Katherine Blair Thaw, belonged to a Pennsylvania family that earned its wealth in the coal business.[2] His grandfather, also called Cord Meyer II, was a property developer and a chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee.\n\nHe was educated at St. Paul's School, New Hampshire, and attended Yale University, where he was a member of the Scroll and Key society, and as a senior was awarded the Alpheus Henry Snow Prize.[3] After graduating in 1942, he joined the 22nd Marine Regiment[4] and fought in the Pacific War; he took part in the Battle of Eniwetok, and in the Battle of Guam as platoon leader, losing his left eye in a grenade attack. He became a first lieutenant and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. He shared his war experiences, writing for The Atlantic Monthly.[5] Meyer's twin brother, Quentin, was killed at Okinawa.[6]",
          "United World Federalists, Inc.": "He was an aide of Harold Stassen to the 1945 San Francisco United Nations Conference on International Organization. In 1947, he was elected president of the United World Federalists (UWF), the organization he helped to fund.[7] In year 1948, Cord was invited to attend the meeting of Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists (ECAS) and he met Albert Einstein,[8][9] Leo Szilard and many of the other leading nuclear physicists.[7] It was when Albert Einstein joined UWF[10] and showed his support and also assisted UEF in fundraising on numerous occasions.[7] In 1949, Cord resigned and was succeeded by Alan Cranstone.[7]",
          "CIA career": "Around 1949, Meyer started working for the Central Intelligence Agency, joining the organization in 1951 at the invitation of Allen Dulles. At first he worked at the Office of Policy Coordination under former OSS man, Frank Wisner.[11] In 1953, Meyer came under attack by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which claimed he was a security risk for having once stood at the same podium of a \"notorious leftist\", and refused to give him a security clearance. An internal CIA inquiry summarily dismissed the claims.[12]\n\nAccording to Deborah Davis in her 1979 book Katharine the Great, Meyer became the \"principal operative\" of Operation Mockingbird, an alleged plan to secretly influence domestic and foreign media.[13] Meyer befriended James Angleton, who in 1954 became the CIA's counter-intelligence chief. From 1954 until 1962, Meyer led the agency's International Organizations Division.[14] Meyer headed the Covert Action Staff of the Directorate of Plans from 1962.[11]\n\nFrom 1967 to 1973, Meyer was assistant deputy director of plans under Thomas Karamessines,[5][15] and from 1973 to 1976 was CIA station chief in London.[16]\n\nSome insiders incorrectly suspected that Cord Meyer was Deep Throat, a key informant in the Watergate Scandal whose identity was a mystery for more than 30 years.[17]",
          "Alleged involvement in JFK assassination": "After the death of former CIA agent and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt in 2007, Saint John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.[18][19] In the April 5, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Saint John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father including Meyer, as well as Lyndon B. Johnson, David Sánchez Morales, David Phillips, Frank Sturgis, an assassin, he termed \"French gunman grassy knoll\" who many presume was Lucien Sarti, and William Harvey.[19][20] The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\", to avoid possible perjury charges.[18] According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain.[18] The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \"inconclusive\".[18]",
          "Personal life": "On April 19, 1945, Meyer married Mary Eno Pinchot, the second daughter of Amos Pinchot and Ruth Pickering Pinchot, in her mother's Park Avenue home in New York City.[21] On 18 December 1956, Meyer's nine-year-old son, Michael (born 1947), was hit by a car and killed. Meyer had two surviving sons, Quentin, born in November 1945, and Mark, born in 1950. Meyer and his wife Mary divorced in 1958. On 12 October 1964, his former wife Mary was shot dead by an unknown assailant alongside the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.[15] Her sister and brother-in-law Benjamin C. Bradlee, later the executive editor of The Washington Post, caught James Angleton breaking into Pinchot's residence.[12] Angleton apparently was looking for Mary Meyer's diary that allegedly contained details of her love affair with John F. Kennedy, the recently assassinated U.S. President.[12][22]\n\nIn 1966, Meyer married Starke Patteson Anderson.[23]",
          "Later years": "He retired from the CIA in 1977. Following retirement, Meyer became a syndicated columnist and wrote several books, including an autobiography.",

          "Lead": "George Sergius de Mohrenschildt[a] (April 17, 1911 – March 29, 1977) was an American petroleum geologist, anti-communist political refugee, professor, and occasional CIA field agent.[1] He moved to the Dallas area in October 1961, and befriended Lee Harvey Oswald in the summer of 1962.\n\nDe Mohrenschildt's testimony before the Warren Commission investigating the assassination was one of the longest of any witness.[2][3]\n\nSince his testimony and subsequent death years later, de Mohrenschildt has been a popular figure in conspiracy theories regarding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. For example, those who believe that the United States Government was responsible have accused de Mohrenschildt of being Oswald's CIA handler. On the other hand, Ion Mihai Pacepa, a high level defector from Communist Romania and occasional CIA asset, has alleged that de Mohrenschildt, despite his claims to be a descendant of the Russian nobility and an anti-communist political refugee from the Red Terror, was in reality a KGB First Chief Directorate illegal field agent, who focused on collecting military intelligence and who acted as Oswald's Soviet intelligence handler.[4][5]",
          "Early life": "De Mohrenschildt was born as Jerzy Sergius von Mohrenschildt in Mozyr, in the Russian Empire, now in Belarus, on April 4, 1911, in the old-style Russian Julian calendar.[6] He had an older brother, Dimitri [ru]. His aristocratic father, Sergey Alexandrovich von Mohrenschildt, was of Baltic German, Swedish, and Russian descent. De Mohrenschildt's mother, Alexandra, was of aristocratic Polish, Russian, and Hungarian descent.[6]\n\nSergey von Mohrenschildt was described by his son as the Marshal of Nobility of the Minsk Governorate[7][8] from 1913-1917, and a civil rank of Actual Civil Councilor corresponding to Major General. In 1920, during the Red Terror and the Russian Civil War, Sergey von Mohrenschildt was arrested by the Bolshevik secret police, or CHEKA, for alleged anti-Soviet agitation.[9] He was sentenced to internal exile for life in Veliky Ustyug, a town in the north of Russia. De Mohrenschildt later testified before the Warren Commission that, while awaiting transport to Veliky Ustyug, his father became ill. Two doctors who treated him in jail advised him to stop eating so he would appear more sickly. The doctors then told the Soviet government that Sergey was too ill to survive the trip to Veliky Ustyug and he should be allowed to recover at home. The Soviet Government agreed, under the condition that Sergey check in weekly until he was well enough to be sent to Veliky Ustyug. After his release, Sergey, his wife and the young de Mohrenschildt then fled to the Second Polish Republic in a hay wagon (de Mohrenschildt's older brother Dimitri, who was awaiting execution, was later repatriated to Poland as part of a prisoner exchange).[10][11] During their journey, de Mohrenschildt, his father and mother Alexandra contracted typhoid fever. Alexandra died of the disease shortly after the family crossed into Poland.[6]\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Sergey von Mohrenschildt and his sons made their way to Wilno (Vilnius), where the family owned a six-acre estate. George de Mohrenschildt graduated from the Wilno gymnasium in 1929 and later graduated from the Polish Army's Cavalry Academy in 1931.[12] He went on to earn a master's degree at the Institute of Higher Commercial Studies.[13] Having completed a dissertation on the economic influence of the U.S. on Latin America, he received a doctor of science degree in international commerce from the University of Liège in Belgium in 1938.[14]\n\nGeorge von Mohrenschildt emigrated to the United States in May 1938, after which he legally Gallicised the nobiliary particle in his name from the German \"von\" to the French \"de\".[15][16][17] According to de Mohrenschildt, he gathered information about people involved in pro-Nazi activities, such as those bidding for US oil leases on behalf of Nazi Germany before the US became involved in World War II.[18] De Mohrenschildt testified that a further purpose of his data collection was to help French petroleum companies outbid the Germans.[19]\n\nGeorge de Mohrenschildt spent the summer of 1938 with his older brother Dimitri von Mohrenschildt on Long Island, New York. Like George, Dimitri von Mohrenschildt was a staunch anti-communist,[20] who was also an anti-Nazi agent for General William J. Donovan's OSS and, during the Cold War, one of the founders of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.[21]\n\nWhile in New York, de Mohrenschildt became acquainted with the Bouvier family, including future First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier. Jacqueline grew up calling de Mohrenschildt \"Uncle George\" and would often sit on his knee.[22] He became a close friend of Jacqueline's aunt Edith Bouvier Beale.[23]\n\nDe Mohrenschildt dabbled in the insurance business from 1939 to 1941, but failed his broker's examination.[24] In 1941, he became associated with Film Facts in New York, a production company owned by his cousin, Berend Maydell, also known as Baron Maydell (or Count Maydell) who allegedly had pro-Nazi sympathies.[citation needed] According to a memo by former CIA director Richard Helms, de Mohrenschildt \"was alleged to be a Nazi espionage agent.\"[25] George de Mohrenschildt denied ever having Nazi sympathies and claimed instead to have helped raise money in America for the Polish resistance, by making a documentary film about resistance fighters in Occupied Poland.[26]\n\nIn 1942, de Mohrenschildt married an American teenager named Dorothy Pierson. They had a daughter, Alexandra (known as Alexis) and divorced in early 1944.[27] In 1945, de Mohrenschildt received a master's degree in petroleum geology from the University of Texas.[28]",
          "Dallas, Oswald and Haiti": "After the end of World War II, de Mohrenschildt moved to Venezuela, where he worked for Hampton Industries Oil, a company owned by the family of Preston A. Hampton[29] In 1947, he married Phyllis Washington, the step-daughter of a diplomat with the State Department, S. Walter Washington. They divorced in 1949.[30] That same year, de Mohrenschildt became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In 1950, he launched an oil investment firm with his step-nephew Edward Hooker, with offices in New York City, Denver, and Abilene.[29] In 1951, de Mohrenschildt's third marriage was to the physician Wynne \"Didi\" Sharples. The following year, the couple settled in Dallas, Texas, where de Mohrenschildt took a job with oilman Clint Murchison as a petroleum geologist.[31] De Mohrenschildt and his third wife had two children, a son and a daughter, both of whom were born with cystic fibrosis (the couple's son died of the disease in 1960, as did their daughter in 1973).[32][33] De Mohrenschildt and Sharples were divorced in 1957.[33]\n\nDe Mohrenschildt joined the Dallas Petroleum Club,[34] was a member of the Dallas Council on World Affairs,[35][36] and taught at a local college. One of his longtime friends, offshore oil engineer George Kitchel, told the FBI that de Mohrenschildt counted among his good friends oil barons Clint Murchison, H.L. Hunt, John W. Mecom Sr., and Sid Richardson.[37] De Mohrenschildt also joined the right-wing Texas Crusade for Freedom, whose members included Earle Cabell, Everette DeGolyer, David Harold Byrd and Ted Dealey.[38]\n\nIn 1957, de Mohrenschildt went to Communist Yugoslavia to conduct a geological field survey for the U.S. State Department-sponsored International Cooperation Administration. While in Yugoslavia, de Mohrenschildt was accused by the secret police, or UDBA, of making drawings of military fortifications. After returning to the United States, de Mohrenschildt was debriefed by the CIA, both in Washington and in Dallas.[39]\n\nFollowing his divorce in 1957, de Mohrenschildt married his fourth wife, former dancer, model, and fellow Russian-American Jeanne LeGon, in June 1959.[40][41] LeGon (née Eugenia Fomenko) was the daughter of a director of the Chinese Far East Railway who was later killed by communists.[42][43][b] From late 1960 and into 1961, he and his wife toured Central America and the Caribbean.[46] His \"walking trip\" through Central America was made to recover from the grief of losing his only son in 1960 to cystic fibrosis. However, de Mohrenschildt also submitted a written report of his trip to the U.S. State Department, and a photograph taken during the trip shows him meeting the American ambassador to Costa Rica.[39]\n\nLee Harvey Oswald and his Russian-born wife Marina Oswald were introduced to de Mohrenschildt in the summer of 1962 in Fort Worth, Texas. De Mohrenschildt testified before the Warren Commission in 1964 that he met the Oswalds through a prominent member of Fort Worth's Russian-American community, oil accountant George Bouhe. When de Mohrenschildt asked whether it was safe to help Oswald, Bouhe said that he had checked with the FBI. De Mohrenschildt also believed that he had discussed Oswald with Max Clark, whom he believed worked for the FBI, and with J. Walton Moore, whom de Mohrenschildt described as \"a Government man — either FBI or Central Intelligence\",[47][48] and who had debriefed de Mohrenschildt several times following his travels abroad, starting in 1957.[48][49] (According to a declassified CIA document, obtained by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, de Mohrenschildt was in fact correct and J. Walton Moore was an agent of the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division in Dallas.)[48] De Mohrenschildt asserted that, shortly after meeting Oswald, he had asked Moore and Fort Worth attorney Max E. Clark about Oswald to reassure himself that it was \"safe\" to assist Oswald. De Mohrenschildt testified that one of the persons with whom he had discussed Oswald told him that Oswald \"seems to be OK,\" and that \"he is a harmless lunatic.\" However, he was no longer sure who had told him that.[50] (When interviewed in 1978 by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, J. Walton Moore said that while he \"had 'periodic' contact with de Mohrenschildt\", he had no recollection of any conversation with him concerning Oswald.[51][48][52] After returning home from a weekend trip to Houston, de Mohrenschildt became aware that someone had broken into his home and copied his personal papers and other documents. At the time, he also had a manuscript that Oswald had given him to read, and realized that the document might also have been photocopied in the search. His primary concern was that the CIA was behind the break-in. According to de Mohrenschildt, Moore flatly denied when confronted that the CIA was involved in any way.[53]\n\nIn October 1962, Oswald informed de Mohrenschildt that he had lost his job in nearby Fort Worth. In response, de Mohrenschildt advised Oswald that he would have a better chance of finding work in Dallas. Oswald was soon hired by the Dallas photographic firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. De Mohrenschildt's wife and daughter would later say that it had been he who had secured the job at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall for Oswald.[54]\n\nOn April 14, 1963, de Mohrenschildt and his wife Jeanne visited the Oswalds' Dallas apartment. As Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle leaning against the wall inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, \"Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?\" (General Edwin Walker was a politician whom de Mohrenschildt \"knew that Oswald disliked.\")[55] When asked by the Warren Commission about Oswald's reaction, de Mohrenschildt replied that Oswald \"smiled at that\".[56] In an interview with Edward Jay Epstein, de Mohrenschildt claimed to have told the CIA that he believed Oswald had attempted to murder General Walker. \"I spoke to the CIA both before and afterwards. It was what ruined me.\"[53] The Warren Commission concluded that on April 10, 1963, Oswald had attempted to murder General Edwin Walker.[57][58]\n\nIn June 1963, de Mohrenschildt moved to Haiti. He never saw Oswald again.[citation needed]\n\nAfter Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, de Mohrenschildt testified before the Warren Commission in April 1964. According to Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, then chief Pentagon-to-CIA liaison officer, de Mohrenschildt also had several private lunches with former CIA director and Warren Commission member Allen Dulles while testifying.[59] In November 1966, de Mohrenschildt left Haiti and returned to Dallas. During 1967, Orleans Parish District Attorney Jim Garrison interviewed de Mohrenschildt and his wife as part of Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw. Garrison said that both of the de Mohrenschildts insisted that Oswald had been the scapegoat in the assassination. Garrison concluded from his conversation with them that George de Mohrenschildt had been one of Oswald's unwitting \"baby-sitters ... assigned to protect or otherwise see to the general welfare of Oswald.\"[60]",
          "Later life, and letter to CIA director": "George and Jeanne de Mohrenschildt obtained a divorce in Dallas, Texas on April 3, 1973, after nearly 14 years of marriage.[61] It was not reported in the local newspapers, and the couple continued to present themselves as husband and wife. [c]\n\nOn September 17, 1976, the CIA requested that the FBI locate de Mohrenschildt, because he had \"attempted to get in touch with the CIA Director.\"[62] On September 5, 1976, de Mohrenschildt had written a letter to the director of the CIA, George H. W. Bush, asking for his assistance. He was acquainted with the Bush family; George H.W. Bush had roomed with de Mohrenschildt's nephew, Edward G. Hooker, at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.[63] The letter said:\n\nYou will excuse this hand-written letter. Maybe you will be able to bring a solution to the hopeless situation I find myself in. My wife and I find ourselves surrounded by some vigilantes; our phone bugged; and we are being followed everywhere. Either FBI is involved in this or they do not want to accept my complaints. We are driven to insanity by the situation. I have been behaving like a damn fool ever since my daughter Nadya died from [cystic fibrosis] over three years ago. I tried to write, stupidly and unsuccessfully, about Lee H Oswald and must have angered a lot of people — I do not know. But to punish an elderly man like myself and my highly nervous and sick wife is really too much. Could you do something to remove the net around us? This will be my last request for help and I will not annoy you any more. Good luck in your important job. Thank you so much.[64][65]\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush responded:\n\nLet me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic death a few years ago, and the current poor state of your wife's health. I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. In your situation I can well imagine how the attentions you described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. The flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren Commission has long subsided. I can only speculate that you may have become \"newsworthy\" again in view of the renewed interest in the Kennedy assassination, and thus may be attracting the attention of people in the media. I hope this letter had been of some comfort to you, George, although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.\n\nOn November 9, 1976, Jeanne had de Mohrenschildt committed to a mental institution in Texas for three months, and listed in a notarized affidavit four previous suicide attempts while he was in the Dallas area. In the affidavit, she stated that de Mohrenschildt suffered from depression, heard voices, saw visions, and believed that the CIA and the Jewish Mafia were persecuting him. However, he was released at the end of the year.[citation needed]",
          "Visit to Europe": "According to the Dutch journalist Willem Oltmans, in 1967 a \"serious and famous Dutch clairvoyant\" named Gerard Croiset had a vision of a conspirator who had manipulated Oswald;[66] his description led Oltmans to de Mohrenschildt, and the two stayed in touch. In 1977, Oltmans went to Texas and brought de Mohrenschildt to the Netherlands.[66] Oltmans claimed that he had rescued de Mohrenschildt from a mental institution to bring him to Croiset. According to Oltmans, Croiset agreed that de Mohrenschildt was the man whom he had seen in his vision.\n\nOltmans says that after de Mohrenschildt arrived in the Netherlands, he invited him out with some Russian friends. They went to Brussels and had plans to go to Liège in Belgium, where de Mohrenschildt had studied in the 1930s. Oltmans owned a house in the countryside not far from Liège. Upon returning to Brussels, de Mohrenschildt went for a short walk from which he failed to return. He had earlier agreed to meet Oltmans and his friends for lunch. Oltmans waited for him but he did not come back.[67]",
          "Death": "On March 16, 1977, de Mohrenschildt returned to the United States from his trip. His daughter talked with him at length and found him to be deeply disturbed about certain matters, reporting that he had expressed a desire to kill himself. On March 29, de Mohrenschildt gave an interview to author Edward Jay Epstein, during which he claimed that in 1962, Dallas CIA operative J. Walton Moore and one of Moore's associates had handed him the address of Oswald in nearby Fort Worth and then suggested that de Mohrenschildt might like to meet him. He suggested to Moore that he would appreciate some help from the U.S. Embassy in Haiti. \"I would never have contacted Oswald in a million years if Moore had not sanctioned it\", de Mohrenschildt said. \"Too much was at stake.\"[53][68] On the same day as the Epstein interview, de Mohrenschildt received a business card from Gaeton Fonzi, an investigator for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, telling him that he would like to see him.[69] The HSCA considered him a \"crucial witness\".[70] That afternoon, de Mohrenschildt was found dead from a shotgun wound to the head in a house at which he was staying in Manalapan, Florida.[71] The coroner's verdict was suicide.[72]\n\nIn the book Killing Kennedy (2012), television personality Bill O'Reilly claimed he had been knocking on de Mohrenschildt's front door when he heard a shotgun blast that marked the suicide.[73] However, this claim has since been proven false. A contemporaneous phone call recording between O'Reilly and Fonzi confirmed that O'Reilly had been investigating the Russian immigrant. However, O'Reilly learned of de Mohrenschildt's suicide from Fonzi and was not even in Florida at the time, but was in Dallas, Texas.[74][75][76]",
          "House Select Committee on Assassinations": "On April 2, 1977, Willem Oltmans told the House Select Committee on Assassinations that de Mohrenschildt had implicated himself in the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. And Pat S. Russell, who was de Mohrenschildt's attorney, said \"I definitely feel there was a conspiracy and that definitely was the opinion of George.\"[77] Oltmans testified for three hours behind closed doors and told the committee that de Mohrenschildt had told him that he had discussed all aspects of the assassination with Oswald. \"De Mohrenschildt told me that Oswald acted at his (de Mohrenschildt's) instructions and that he knew Oswald was going to kill Kennedy,\" Oltmans said.[78][79]\n\nOn July 6, 1978, Joseph Dryer told the HSCA that he and de Mohrenschildt were associated with a woman named Jacqueline Lancelot. Dryer's relationship with Lancelot included passing messages for her to people in the United States whom Dryer assumed were connected in some way to the CIA. Dryer said that Lancelot had told him shortly after the assassination that a \"substantial\" sum of money, $200,000 or $250,000, had been deposited in de Mohrenschildt's account. Dryer said that de Mohrenschildt had claimed that he had come to Haiti to scout for oil, but Dryer stated that \"I could never figure out what he did.\" Dryer expressed the belief that de Mohrenschildt had \"some intelligence connection.\"[80]\n\nCongressional researcher Gaeton Fonzi noted that in late 1963 \"several large deposits popped up in de Mohrenschildt's Haitian bank account including one for two hundred thousand dollars from a Bahamian bank.\"[81] This occurred when de Mohrenschildt and Clemard Joseph Charles, an advisor to Haitian president Francois \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier, \"were 'supposedly' running a sisal plantation, a derelict operation they never went near.\"[81]\n\nIn a 1976 CIA internal memo regarding de Mohrenschildt, Director George H. W. Bush stated: \"At one time he had/or spent plenty of money.\"[82]",
          "Another backyard photo": "On April 1, 1977, Jeanne de Mohrenschildt gave the House Select Committee on Assassinations a print of a photograph showing Lee Harvey Oswald standing in his Dallas backyard holding two newspapers and a rifle, and with a pistol on his hip – a photograph taken by Oswald's wife Marina. While similar to other prints that had been found among Oswald's effects on November 23, 1963, the existence of this particular print was previously unknown. On the back was written \"To my friend George from Lee Oswald\" and the date \"5/IV/63\" (April 5, 1963),[83] along with the words \"Copyright Geo de M\" and a Russian phrase translated as \"'Hunter after fascists, ha-ha-ha!!!\" Handwriting specialists later concluded that the words \"To my friend George ...\" and Oswald's signature were written by Lee Harvey Oswald, but could not determine whether the rest was the writing of Oswald, his wife, or de Mohrenschildt.[84] De Mohrenschildt assumed that Marina had written it sarcastically.[84]\n\nDe Mohrenschildt wrote in his manuscript that he had missed Oswald's photograph in packing for the move to Haiti in May 1963, which was why he had not mentioned it to the Warren Commission (though he had noted in his manuscript that Oswald had a rifle in April 1963, and scoffed to Oswald that he had missed General Walker, remembering that Oswald had blanched at the joke). According to de Mohrenschildt, the photograph was not found among his stored papers until he and his wife found it in February 1967. When analyzed by the HSCA in 1977, this photo turned out to be a first-generation print of the backyard photo already known to the Warren Commission as \"CE-133A\" and which had probably been taken on March 31, 1963.[85]",
          "Memoir": "Jeanne de Mohrenschildt also gave the HSCA a copy of a draft manuscript called I Am a Patsy! I Am a Patsy!, which George de Mohrenschildt had completed in the summer of 1976 about his relationship with his \"dear, dead friend\" Oswald. In the manuscript, he said that the Oswald he knew was rarely ever violent, and would not have been the sort of person to have killed Kennedy. In part, this judgment was based on de Mohrenschildt's estimation of Oswald's political views and Kennedy's liberal ideas. Until 2014 the memoir had never been published as a standalone book, but the entire typescript was published as an appendix in the HSCA report.[80]\n\nThe primary focus of de Mohrenschildt's text is a series of recollections about the brief time period between September 1962 and April 1963 when he and his wife were acquainted with the Oswalds. A secondary focus consists of a number of meditations on the corrosive effects the Oswalds had on the professional and personal lives of the de Mohrenschildts. \"It must be acknowledged that our brief friendship with the Oswalds had strange and adverse effects on our lives.\" The manuscript is less concerned with Oswald's guilt or innocence than with suggesting who the real criminals might be. Stating that Oswald was a \"patsy not involved in any revenge\", and referencing articles describing \"organized murder for profit\", de Mohrenschildt challenges readers to make up their own minds. De Mohrenschildt's manuscript was edited and annotated as Lee Harvey Oswald as I Knew Him by Michael A. Rinella. It was released in November 2014 by the University Press of Kansas.[86]",
          "Depictions in popular media": "De Mohrenschildt was played by Willem Oltmans, the Dutch journalist who befriended him in the late 1960s, in the 1991 film JFK, and by Bill Bolender in the 1993 TV movie Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. He is also mentioned at length in the Stephen King novel 11/22/63, a time-travel novel about the assassination, and appears in the 2016 television adaptation 11.22.63, played by Jonny Coyne. His Haitian experience is depicted in Hans Christoph Buch's novel Haïti Chérie (Suhrkamp, 1990).\n\nDe Mohrenschildt was discussed at length in the TruTV series Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura. The episode claims that de Mohrenschildt was in fact a CIA handler for Oswald.\n\nIn 1997, Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh released the film Willem Oltmans, De Eenmotorige Mug (Willem Oltmans, the single-engined mosquito). In the film, journalist Willem Oltmans makes claims about his contacts with de Mohrenschildt (and Oswald's mother, Marguerite Oswald) until de Mohrenschildt's death in 1977.[87]\n\n^ Russian: Георгий Сергеевич де Мореншильд, romanized: Georgy Sergeyevich de Morenshild\n^ Jeanne LeGon had a daughter named Jeanne Elinor LeGon.[44][45]\n^ For example, from the death investigation report by Thomas Neighbors of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office:\nAt 2315 hours, on 29 March 1977, this writer made contact with the victim's wife, MRS.

          "Lead": "David Sánchez Morales (August 26, 1925 – May 8, 1978) was a Central Intelligence Agency operative who worked in Cuba and Chile.",
          "Biographical highlights": "Morales, Mexican descent, spent his early life in Phoenix, Arizona, and attended school at Arizona State College in Tempe (now Arizona State University) and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles before joining the Army in 1946. He served in the 82nd Airborne, and was recruited into US Army intelligence during that time.[1] Morales maintained an Army 'cover' even after joining the Central Intelligence Agency in 1951.\n\nShortly after joining the CIA, Morales became an operative for the CIA's Directorate for Plans. It is alleged that he was involved in Executive Action, a series of projects designed to kill foreign leaders deemed unfriendly to the United States. Morales reportedly was involved in Operation PBSuccess, the CIA covert operation that overthrew the democratically elected President of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.[2]\n\nThrough the 1960s and mid-1970s, Morales was involved at top levels in a variety of covert projects, including JMWAVE, the ZRRIFLE plot to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Bay of Pigs Invasion operation, the CIA's secret war in Laos,[2] the capture of Che Guevara, and the overthrow of Salvador Allende.[citation needed]",
          "John F. Kennedy": "After the death of E. Howard Hunt in 2007, John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.[3][4] In the April 5, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father including Morales, as well as Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Atlee Phillips, Frank Sturgis, William Harvey and an assassin he termed \"French gunman grassy knoll\" who some presume was Lucien Sarti.[4][5] (Lucien Sarti was in prison in France at the time of the assassination,[6] but Corsican hit man, Jean Souetre, who came to New York on Nov 19, 1963 and then left the country from Laredo, Texas on Dec 6[7] is thought more likely to be the “Sarte” or “Satre” mentioned in Hunt's son's book[8] as the Corsican assassin allegedly contracted for \"the big event\".[7])\n\nThe two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\", to avoid possible perjury charges.[3] According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain.[3]\n\nMorales' friend, Ruben Carbajal, claimed that in 1973 Morales opened up about his involvement with the Bay of Pigs Invasion operation, and stated that \"Kennedy had been responsible for him having to watch all the men he recruited and trained get wiped out.\" Carbajal claimed that Morales said, \"Well, we took care of that SOB, didn't we?\"[9]\n\nMorales is alleged to have once told friends, \"I was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch, and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard\".[10] presumably referring to the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, and to the later assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles, California, on June 5, 1968.[11] Morales is alleged to have expressed deep anger toward the Kennedys for what he saw as their betrayal during the Bay of Pigs Invasion.[12]",
          "Robert F. Kennedy": "In November 2006, BBC Television's Newsnight aired a twelve-minute screening of Shane O'Sullivan's documentary RFK Must Die.[12][13] O'Sullivan stated that while researching a screenplay based on the Manchurian candidate theory for the assassination of Robert Kennedy, he \"uncovered new video and photographic evidence suggesting that three senior CIA operatives were behind the killing\".[12][13] He claimed that three men seen in video and photographs of the Ambassador Hotel immediately before and after the assassination were positively identified as CIA operatives Gordon Campbell, George Joannides, and Morales.[12][13] Several people who had known Morales, including family members, were adamant that he was not the man who O'Sullivan said was Morales.[13] After O'Sullivan published his book, assassination researchers Jefferson Morley and David Talbot also discovered that Campbell had died of a heart attack in 1962, six years prior to the assassination of Kennedy.[13] In response, O'Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell's name as an alias.[13] He then took his identifications to the Los Angeles Police Department whose files showed the men he identified as Campbell and Joannides to be Michael Roman and Frank Owens, two Bulova sales managers attending the company's convention in the Ambassador.[13] O'Sullivan stood by his allegations stating that the Bulova watch company was a \"well-known CIA cover\".[13]\n\n^ Fonzi, Gaeton.

          "Biography": "Nichols was a graduate of the Southern Methodist University Law School, class of 1940. He was a lawyer in Dallas for over 60 years, practicing Civil Law. Nichols was a member of the American Bar Association; Texas Bar Association and other legal associations. During World War II, he served in the Army Corps of Engineers (1941–1946), and later retired from the United States Army Reserve in 1968, holding the rank of colonel.[3]",
          "Lee Harvey Oswald": "Nichols stated that by 2:00 pm on Saturday, November 23, 1963, he began receiving telephone calls from Dallas attorneys who were concerned that Oswald was stating he had no legal representation while being questioned by the Dallas Police Department. Oswald was being questioned at the time with regards to the assassination of President Kennedy as well as the shooting of Dallas Police officer J. D. Tippit.[2] Law school deans were contacting the Dallas Bar Association expressing concern that \"only a legal backwater would deny an attorney to a murder suspect\".[2]\n\nNichols, who practiced civil law in the Dallas area was the president of the Dallas Bar Association at the time. In 1963, criminal suspects in Texas had no right to a lawyer while being questioned.[2] However, Nichols was concerned and believed that Oswald needed legal representation, despite the fact that it was clear Oswald was unable to pay for an attorney to represent him. He decided to go to the Dallas Police Department and offer his services, despite the fact he was unfamiliar with criminal law.[2]\n\nUpon arrival at the Police Department, he announced to police officials he was an attorney and was there to speak to Oswald. He was accompanied to Oswald's cell, where he found him sitting by himself between two empty adjacent cells, with a police officer just outside the door of the cell. Oswald was calm and rested in the cell with a bruise over one eye. He stated that the police were holding him \"incommunicado\" and denied killing either Kennedy or Tippit.[2]\n\nOswald stated to Nichols that he wanted John Abt, an attorney from New York to represent him. Abt was associated with the American Civil Liberties Union. Nichols asked Oswald if he wanted him or a Dallas lawyer to represent him. Oswald stated \"No, not right now.\"[2]\n\nNichols then left Oswald to be alone in his cell and departed from the Dallas Police station.[2] Nichols' visit with Oswald lasted approximately two minutes.[4] Oswald was killed the next day by Jack Ruby.\n\nLaw portal\n1960s portal\n\nLaw portal\n\n1960s portal\n\n^ H.

Nicoletti was murdered on March 29, 1977.",
          "Early life": "Nicoletti was born on December 3, 1916, in Chicago. He was the second son of two sons to Philip Nicoletti and Grace Alessi,[1] Italian immigrants from Santa Caterina Villarmosa, Sicily, Italy. His family lived in Near West Side, Chicago. On February 25, 1929, at the age of 12, Nicoletti shot his father four times, allegedly in self-defense.[2][3] His father who was a drunkard, attacked Charles and pursued him with a knife, he ran into his father's room, where a gun was kept in a bureau drawer.[4] Two days later, Nicoletti was exonerated by the Cook County coroner.[4] He dropped out of school in eighth grade and soon joined the Forty-Two Gang. At the time, the gang's members included such future Outfit members as Giancana, Sam \"Teets\" Battaglia, Lew Farrell, \"Mad Sam\" DeStefano and William \"Willie Potatoes\" Daddano.",
          "Outfit assassin": "By the late 1950s, along with Felix Alderisio, Nicoletti was one of the most feared triggermen in Chicago and was drawing attention from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Chicago police. A number of times Nicoletti and Alderisio teamed up for a \"hit\", including one occasion on which they were discovered by police sitting on the floor in a car later dubbed \"the hitmobile\" by reporters. This car had special compartments where guns were stored and special switches to turn lights off at certain times.[5] When questioned by police the two said they were \"waiting for a friend\".[5]\n\nIn 1962, Nicoletti took part in an infamous torture case. He, Alderisio, Carlo \"Duke\" Olandese and Tony \"the Ant\" Spilotro, had kidnapped 24-year-old Billy McCarthy, a thug who had killed two Outfit associates with the help of Jimmy Miraglia, also age 24. The three men started torturing McCarthy to find out the name of his accomplice. Spilotro had placed the man's head in an industrial vise and started squeezing it tighter and tighter. Suddenly, McCarthy's eye popped completely out of its socket.[6] At that point, he revealed his accomplice's name; then both men were killed. Years later, Tony Spilotro told this story to his friend Frank Cullotta. Spilotro was impressed by Nicoletti's reaction to the gory scene: \"Boy, this is a heartless guy. He was eating pasta when Billy's eye popped out\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Nicoletti was questioned by two FBI agents, including Agent William F. Roemer Jr., to see whether they could develop Nicoletti as an informant against the Outfit. According to Roemer, Nicoletti gave him the names of several car dealerships he worked at and was very cordial; apparently, all the employment leads checked out. But Nicoletti never flipped and never talked to the FBI again, though there was eventually talk in Chicago that Nicoletti had flipped.[7]\n\nIt has been alleged that Nicoletti was involved in as many as 20 mob hits during his career as a hitman.[8] In 2010, Playboy magazine published an article by Hillel Levin in which Nicoletti was implicated in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by James Files, an inmate within the Illinois Department of Corrections, and Chauncey Marvin Holt.[9]",
          "Death": "On March 29, 1977, Nicoletti was shot three times in the back of his head while waiting in his Oldsmobile in the parking lot of the Golden Horns Restaurant in suburban Northlake, Illinois. He was brought to the Northlake Community Hospital, where he died six to seven hours later.[10] Nicoletti's car was never turned off and consequently overheated and caught on fire, causing initial incorrect press reports that his car was firebombed. Nicoletti was due to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations at the time of his death. George de Mohrenschildt was likewise scheduled to testify before that committee and died on the same day.\n\nAccording to Roemer, Chicago mob assassin Harry Aleman is the suspected hitman.[11][12]\n\nNicoletti is buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.\n\nList of organized crime killings in Illinois\nList of unsolved murders\n\nList of organized crime killings in Illinois\n\nList of unsolved murders\n\n^ \"DEATH NOTICIES\".

          "Lead": "Silvia Odio del Torro (born 1937)[1] is a Cuban-American who provided testimony to the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy that Lee Harvey Oswald was one of three strangers who visited her Dallas, Texas apartment in September 1963 to solicit money for the anti-Castro counterrevolutionary group JURE.[2]",
          "Background": "Odio was born in Havana, Cuba in 1937, and she remained in Cuba until 1960.[3] She was one of ten children born to Amador and Sarah Odio.[4] Her brother Cesar was a city manager for Miami, Florida for 11 years.[2][5]",
          "Warren Commission testimony and investigation": "On July 22, 1964, Odio provided testimony to Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (known informally as the Warren Commission), at the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Dallas.[1]\n\nOdio testified that during the last week of September 1963 three strangers, whom she described as two Latinos and an American, visited her Dallas apartment. They requested that she assist in the preparation of a letter to solicit funds for the Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE), the anti-Castro organization to which Odio and her parents belonged. Her father, a former guerilla in Castro's army, was a political prisoner jailed in Cuba for his strong opposition to Castro's communist government.[6]\n\nOdio testified that the men identified themselves by their \"war names\". She could remember only the name of the talkative one, Leopoldo, who introduced the American to Silvia as Leon Oswald.[6] Leopoldo told her that Oswald, who had been in the Marine Corps and was an excellent shot,[6] could be very useful to JURE. Leopoldo said that they had come from New Orleans and were about to leave on a trip, though he did not specify the destination.[6] Odio did not permit the men to enter her apartment, and she declined their request to translate the letter. She told them that she would first write a letter to her father to ask if he knew of Leopoldo or Angelo. Odio later testified that she was certain that the American was Lee Harvey Oswald.[6]\n\nOdio claimed that later that week, Leopoldo phoned her and said that that Leon had accused the Cubans of cowardice, saying that they \"don't have any guts... because President Kennedy should have been assassinated after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that, because he was the one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually.\"[6]\n\nThe Warren Commission stated in its final report that it had investigated Odio's statements in its efforts to determine whether Oswald was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.[7][nb 1] The commission's investigation showed that Oswald had departed Dallas for New Orleans on April 24, 1963 and lived there until traveling to Mexico City in late September.[6] Oswald was in New Orleans at least until September 23, the day on which Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald back to Paine's home in the Dallas suburb of Irving. The commission found that Oswald had cashed an unemployment check on September 25, firmly establishing his presence in New Orleans.[8]\n\nThe commission held that Oswald may have taken a Continental Trailways bus from New Orleans to Houston on September 25, and that there was \"strong evidence\" in the form of ticket purchase records and eyewitness reports that he took a bus from Houston to Laredo, Texas on September 26.[9] Other evidence established that Oswald had crossed into Mexico on September 26 and returned across the American border on October 3, the same day on which he returned to Dallas.[9]\n\nThe commission noted a window of time between the morning of September 25 and the early morning of September 26 for which it could not account, but stated that it was not plausible or supported by the evidence that Oswald took a car, bus or airplane from New Orleans to Dallas to see Odio and then back to Houston to depart for Laredo in that period of time.[9] It also stated that comments that Oswald had allegedly made to passengers on the bus to Laredo and a telephone call that he placed to a resident in Houston suggest that he was not in Dallas on September 25 but was traveling from New Orleans in a bus.[10] The commission was \"almost certain\" that Oswald could not have been in Dallas in the time period specified by Odio (although Odio specified no exact date). However, it requested that the FBI conduct further investigation of Odio's testimony, including the possibility that Oswald may have been with others during his trip to Mexico.[10]\n\nIn an effort to locate and identify the men whom Odio had said were with Oswald, the FBI interviewed two anti-Castro leaders who denied knowledge of Odio's allegations.[10] Additional investigation, including another interview of Odio, was conducted to find the men who had visited her apartment.[10]\n\nThe commission's final report held that the FBI had located a participant in anti-Castro activities, Loran Hall, who stated that he had visited Odio in September 1964 with Larry Howard and William Seymour.[10] The report stated: \"While the FBI had not yet completed its investigation into this matter at the time the report went to press, the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was 'not' at Mrs. Odio's apartment in September of 1963.\"[10]",
          "House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation": "The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) stated in its 1979 final report that it had investigated the possibility that anti-Castro Cuban groups and individuals had been involved in the assassination.[11] The committee's report summarized the Warren Commission's findings regarding the Odio incident and stated that general counsel J. Lee Rankin did not receive portions of the FBI's investigation until after the commission's final report had been published.[12]\n\nAccording to the HSCA, Howard and Seymour denied having met Odio, and Hall later retracted his statement that the three of them had met Odio.[13] The suspicious nature of Loran Hall's confession to the FBI, while substituting William Seymour's name with that of Lee Harvey Oswald, and then the final retraction of his entire confession, was not further explored by the HSCA.\n\nOdio was interviewed by the HSCA, as were her family, her psychiatrist, Hall, Seymour, Larry Howard and the FBI agent who had interviewed Hall.[14]\n\nThe HSCA reported that it was \"inclined to believe Silvia Odio\" and that at least one of the men resembled Oswald.[15] The HSCA did not agree with the Warren Commission that Oswald could not have been in Dallas during the time period specified in Odio's allegations and reported the most likely dates for the encounter to be September 25, 26 or 27, 1963.[15] The committee stated that Oswald's actions and values were consistent with one who would favor the Castro regime, and speculated that Oswald may have associated with anti-Castro activists to implicate movements such as JURE in the assassination or for some unrelated reason.[16]\n\nThe HSCA concluded that \"it was unable to reach firm conclusions as to the meaning or significance of the Odio incident to the President's assassination.\"[17]",
          "Silvia Odio, Loran Hall and Harry Dean": "Harry Dean, a writer and volunteer FBI informant in Chicago and Southern California, claimed that the two Latinos were actually two of his closest freedom-fighter friends, Cuban-American Loran Hall and Mexican-American Larry Howard. Dean said that Hall regularly used his war name of Lorenzo while Howard's war name was Alonzo.\n\nDean wrote in his 1990 book Crosstrails[18] that he and the group's leader Guy Gabaldon would solicit cash, medical supplies and paramilitary donations from Southern California members of the John Birch Society and store them in Gabaldon's garage. Dean would then help Hall and Howard load their trailer so that they could drive across the country delivering the donations to anti-Castro paramilitary groups. Dean alleged that Gabaldon issued instructions to Hall and Howard to drive Lee Harvey Oswald from New Orleans to Mexico, and that Loran made a detour to the home of Odio at 8 p.m., most likely on September 26, 1963.\n\n^ The Warren Commission's report also said that Odio's sister briefly saw the three men when answering the door (and peeking out the living room window) and was also certain that the American was Lee Harvey Oswald.[6]\n\n^ The Warren Commission's report also said that Odio's sister briefly saw the three men when answering the door (and peeking out the living room window) and was also certain that the American was Lee Harvey Oswald.[6]\n\n^\na b \"Testimony of Sylvia Odio\".

Kennedy, as he was an acquaintance of Lee Harvey Oswald. His wife, Ruth Paine, housed Oswald’s wife, Marina Oswald, in her home for several months before the assassination until the day after it.",
          "Early life": "Paine was born in New York, New York. His father was Lyman Paine, an architect and activist. His mother was Ruth Forbes Young, financial backer of International Peace Academy and daughter of Elise Cabot Forbes, a scion of the Cabot family. He had one sibling, Cameron Paine.[1]\n\nPaine graduated from high school in New York in 1947. He attended Harvard University for two years in 1947-1949 and Swarthmore College for a year, but did not graduate.[1]",
          "Career": "After serving in the U.S. Army, Paine worked a few months for Griswold Manufacturing Co. After that, Paine worked at the Bartol Research Foundation in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania for about a year. He then worked for his mother's third husband Arthur M. Young, making helicopter models in Pennsylvania.[1]\n\nIn 1958, Paine became employed at Bell Helicopter[1] through Young, his stepfather and designer of the first commercial helicopter, Bell 47.",
          "Personal life": "In 1957, he married Ruth Avery Hyde in Pennsylvania. They had two children:[1] Lynn (b. 1959) and Christopher (b. 1961).[2] In 1959, they relocated to 2525 West Fifth Street in Irving, Texas, a Dallas suburb,[2] when Paine began work at a Bell Helicopter facility in Fort Worth. One issue is whether the Minox camera found in the Paine garage belonged to Lee Oswald or to Michael Paine. Another issue is what activities Lee Oswald and Michael Paine had in common, given Michael Paine's statement to Frontline (Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald?, PBS) that he and Lee Oswald shared unspecified interests.\n\nIn late September 1962, Paine and his wife Ruth separated, Ruth asked him to have his personal belongings moved out of the house by the time she got back home from traveling around the United States that summer. According to Michael, it was not he, but Ruth who pushed to legally end their marriage. As their divorce made its way through the legal system until it ended in 1970, the Paines continued to see films at the theater together, and their Madrigal singing as a couple continued. Michael kept his own apartment in Arlington, Texas, while Ruth remained with Lynn and Christopher in the Irving home. In the end, the divorce was amicable, and Michael kept a very favorable view of Ruth.[3]\n\nOn February 22, 1963, Ruth Paine attended a party held at the home of her fellow madrigal singer, Everett Glover, who knew that Ruth was learning to speak Russian and thought she might be interested in meeting a couple he knew, Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald.[4]\n\nLee had defected to the USSR after serving in the Marine Corps, and Marina was Russian-born.[5] They had recently returned to the United States with their young daughter, June.[5] Everett invited many of his engineer friends in Dallas to attend, including George de Mohrenschildt, Volkmar Schmidt, Michael Paine, and many others. Everett thought they would all be interested in interviewing Lee Harvey Oswald. He also thought that Ruth would enjoy practicing her Russian conversation skills with a native Russian speaker, Marina Oswald.\n\nMichael Paine caught a cold that night, and didn't go, but Ruth Paine did go to the party, and met Marina Oswald for the first time. Ruth started a close friendship with Marina that would last until the JFK Assassination.\n\nIn the spring of 1963, Michael Paine was engaging students from Southern Methodist University in debate and discussion \"about communism in general and Cuba in particular\". During these debates, Michael took the role of a Castro advocate, bragging about being familiar with an actual communist, “an ex-Marine who had recently returned to the States with a Russian wife,” referencing Oswald. Michael also encouraged these students to go to local commie cell gatherings.[6]",
          "Relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald": "As April 1963 began, Ruth planned to cook dinner for the Oswalds at her home, and she asked Michael to pick them up and drive them to her house. (The Oswalds had no car.) Michael met the Oswalds for the first time on April 2, 1963. He picked up Lee, Marina, and their baby daughter, June at their apartment at 214 West Neely Street in Dallas. Before he drove them to Ruth's house, he had to endure a long wait as Marina got ready.\n\nFrom the start (Michael told the Warren Commission) he took an immediate dislike toward Lee Oswald, who continually barked orders at his wife, Marina, from the living room, without lifting a finger to help her. Lee's demeaning words directed at his wife offended Michael, who told author Thomas Mallon that he pitied Marina for \"having to take these whiplashes meekly and quietly and obediently.\"\n\nMichael neglected to tell the Warren Commission, however, that Lee Harvey Oswald had also used that time to speak with Michael about his fervent political views, and to proudly display to Michael a now-famous \"backyard photograph.\" This was one of four known photos of Lee holding his rifle, wearing his pistol, and displaying two Marxist newspapers.\n\nOn the contrary, Michael swore to the Warren Commission that he had 'no idea' that Lee Harvey Oswald ever had a rifle. In 1993, however, Michael Paine told Gus Russo, author of 'Live by the Sword' (1998) that Lee Oswald showed him this famous Backyard Photograph at their first meeting on April 2, 1963.\n\nOver the next seven months, Michael told the Warren Commission, he was continually upset by the fact that Lee Oswald refused to let Marina learn to read, speak, or write in English.[7]\n\nMichael did not emphasize for the Warren Commission the several talks that he had with Lee Oswald about the radical right wing and resigned General Edwin Walker, who had been making trouble for JFK since October 1962. All he knew was that he and Lee Oswald 'agreed' about General Walker.[citation needed]\n\nThe Warren Commission was far more interested in the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald lived in a rented room in Dallas, but stored most of his possessions in Paine's garage. This is because Marina Oswald told Dallas Police that Lee Oswald kept an army rifle there, wrapped in a blanket. Michael Paine told the Warren Commission that he always thought it was camping equipment.[1]\n\nPaine's wife helped Oswald get a job at the Texas School Book Depository. Paine's testimony would later become a central feature of the Warren Commission's investigation of the assassination, particularly in regard to the presence of the purported assassination rifle in the garage of his family home.\n\nPaine and his wife were portrayed in Oliver Stone's JFK as characters called \"Bill and Janet Williams,\" presumably to avoid legal action.[8]\n\nIn 1964, Paine testified that he was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union.[1]\n\nThe Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported that Paine died March 1, 2018, in Sebastopol, California.[9]\n\nThe 2022 documentary The Assassination & Mrs. Paine explores the Paines and their connections to the assassination.\n\n^\na b c d e f g \"Testimony Of Michael R.

          "Lead": "Ruth Hyde Paine (born September 3, 1932) is [citation needed] a former friend of Marina Oswald, who was living with her at the time of the JFK assassination. According to official government investigations,[1] including the Warren Commission, Lee Harvey Oswald stored the 6.5 mm caliber Carcano rifle used to shoot U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Ruth Paine's garage, unbeknownst to her and her husband, Michael Paine.[2][3][4]\n\nRuth Paine answered more than 5,000 questions for the Warren Commission.[citation needed] There were over 500 witnesses for the Warren Commission, and the average number of questions asked for each witness was less than 300.[citation needed] Furthermore, Ruth Paine has given more interviews than any other Warren Commission witness, always consistent with her Warren Commission testimony.[citation needed]",
          "Early life": "Paine was born Ruth Avery Hyde in New York City to William A. and Carol E. Hyde.[5] She went to Antioch College in Ohio and became a Quaker. She met her future husband Michael Paine through her interest in folk dancing and music. Though not a Quaker himself, Michael attended meetings with Ruth. They married on December 28, 1957.\n\nIn 1959 Michael Paine got a job with Bell Helicopter in Fort Worth, Texas,[6] 30 miles from Dallas, and the Paines moved into a house in the suburb of Irving (Michael Paine's step-father, Arthur M. Young, designed the first Bell Helicopter). As liberals in Dallas, the Paines were isolated, and Ruth Paine was quite lonely.[4]\n\nRuth Paine had been studying Russian since 1957. In the late 1950s, she participated in Quaker pen pal programs and the East-West Contact Committee, which sponsored visits by three Soviets to the US. In 1963 she signed up to teach a summer class in Russian at St. Mark's School in Dallas, but only one student signed up (William Hootkins, who became an actor and had a minor role in the movie Star Wars as X-wing pilot Jek Porkins).\n\nRuth Paine met the Oswalds through her interest in the Russian language. She had learned to read Russian but needed help with conversational Russian. Also, she and Michael Paine were separated at this time. A mutual friend from their Madrigal singing group, Everett Glover, invited her to a party at his apartment on February 22, 1963, because he thought she would be interested in meeting two interesting people who spoke Russian.[4]\n\nThe attendance of the couple, Lee and Marina Oswald, was arranged by Oswald's friend, 51-year-old White Russian émigré aristocrat George de Mohrenschildt,[7][8] a well-educated petroleum geologist with intelligence connections.[9]",
          "Involvement with Oswald family": "Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald to New Orleans when the Oswalds moved there in May 1963[10] and back to Dallas when they moved again in September 1963.[10][11] When the Oswalds resettled in the Dallas area, Marina and her child with Lee, June, moved in with Ruth Paine in the suburb of Irving, Texas, while Lee stayed in a boarding house under the name O.H. Lee. The second Oswald child was born after Marina moved in. Marina helped with the housework and Ruth's Russian studies while Lee visited on weekends. Michael and Ruth had long been separated, but remained on good terms. Michael was a frequent visitor and cared for his children deeply. At the suggestion of a neighbor, Linnie Mae Randle, Ruth Paine told Lee Oswald about a job opportunity at the Texas School Book Depository.[12]\n\nLee Harvey Oswald stayed at the Paine home with Marina and his children unannounced on Thursday night, November 21, 1963—the night before President Kennedy was assassinated.[13] When Oswald left for work on the morning of November 22, he brought a large package that he had kept in the Paine's garage with him to work at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald's coworker and friend, Wesley Frazier testified that Oswald told him the bag contained curtain rods.[14][15] The Warren Commission later concluded that the package actually contained the rifle used by Oswald in the assassination.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][failed verification]\n\nEight days after the assassination of President Kennedy, on November 30, 1963, Ruth Paine inadvertently discovered evidence possibly linking him to an attempted assassination of General Edwin Walker. Among the letters that Ruth Paine reportedly sent to Marina was a thick book of household advice in Russian. The book contained an undated note left by Lee for Marina on April 10, 1963 (the day of the Walker assassination attempt) that Marina later testified she had concealed.[24][25][26][27] Before the Kennedy assassination, Dallas police had no suspects in the Walker shooting.[25][26][28]",
          "Aftermath of assassination": "Ruth Paine testified before the Warren Commission. She said she would not use the word \"mister\" as it was \"contrary to Quaker practice\" though she later called Guy Mamantov \"Mr. Mamantov\".[29] She described an \"Impression of the Impression\" routine, with Michael and Lee Oswald: \"It has to be my impression of his impressions. I don't recall the evening too well, the evening of the second. I do recall we certainly had dinner together. I can't recall what the predominant language was. Lee and Michael, of course, talked in English. Not wanting to exclude her entirely from the conversation, I made opportunity to talk with her in Russian after the meal was over. She and I did the dishes and talked in Russian, and we were in the kitchen while Michael was talking to Lee in English in the living room, so I do not know what was said then between the two of them.\"[30]\n\nPaine has been interviewed by several authors, including Priscilla Johnson McMillan, William Manchester, Thomas Mallon, and Gerald Posner. She also testified in Jim Garrison's trial of Clay Shaw. Paine was not called to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations.[4] She even testified at a 1986 mock trial of Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nAfter the assassination, Marina and Lee Oswald's mother, Marguerite, briefly stayed with Ruth Paine until Marina was taken into custody by the Secret Service. Marguerite and Lee's brother Robert did not like Ruth Paine, which may have influenced Marina Oswald. They thought Paine sought attention for herself, an opinion Marina would later express before the Warren Commission. When Marina testified in the Shaw trial, she said she had been \"advised by the Secret Service not to be connected with (Ruth Paine)...She was sympathizing with the CIA.\"[31] Ruth wrote to Marina incessantly, with letters that took an almost desperate tone, but received no response except for a Christmas card. They met briefly in 1964 but have not seen each other since. Paine heard news about Marina through author Priscilla Johnson McMillan[32] until McMillan's relationship with Marina broke off in the early 1980s.\n\nRuth Paine returned to Pennsylvania and became principal of a Quaker school in the Greene Street Friends School in Germantown. She soon moved to St. Petersburg, Florida and earned a master's degree in psychology from the University of South Florida. After working for the school system in Franklin County in the Florida Panhandle, she returned to St. Petersburg and worked for the Hillsborough County, Florida school system until her retirement. She is active in Quaker and liberal charities and organizations and lives in Santa Rosa, California.\n\nThe City of Irving bought the former Paine home on W. 5th St. in 2009 to restore it to its 1963 condition and turn it into a museum in time for the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 2013.[13]\n\nAuthor and researcher Sylvia Meagher wrote:\n\nRuth Paine...is a complex personality, despite her rather passive façade...Some examples from her testimony show a predisposition against Oswald and a real or pretended friendliness toward the FBI and other Establishment institutions, which should not be overlooked in evaluating her role in the case...Mrs. Paine is sometimes a devious person, and her testimony must be evaluated in that light.[33]\n\nPaine has expressed her belief in the official conclusion that Oswald acted alone and has denied conspiracy theorists' suggestions to connect her and Michael to their relatives and ancestors holding important government and business positions, such as her sister, Sylvia Hyde Hoke, being listed as an employee of CIA .[34]\n\nIn Oliver Stone's JFK, the Paines are depicted as the highly suspect Bill and Janet Williams, played by Gary Carter and Gail Cronauer. While most names in the movie JFK were not changed, the Paines were renamed to avoid potential legal action. (The name Janet Williams was used again in the 1993 TV movie Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald, in which Quenby Bakke played the role.) The 2022 documentary The Assassination & Mrs. Paine explores the Paines and their connections to the assassination.\n\n^ These were investigations by: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1963), the Warren Commission (1964), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979), and the Dallas Police Department.\n^ \"Chapter 4: The Assassin\".

          "Teamster Union and mob activities": "Partin was the business manager of the five local IBT branches in Baton Rouge for 30 years. In 1961, he was charged by the union with embezzlement as union money was stolen from a safe. Two key witnesses in the grand jury died. He was indicted on June 27, 1962, for 26 counts of embezzlement and falsification and released on bail.\n\nOn August 14, 1962, Partin was sued for his role in a traffic accident injuring two passengers and killing a third. He was also indicted for first-degree manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident. He also surrendered himself for aggravated kidnapping.\n\nHe was finally convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice through witness tampering and perjury in March 1979.[2] Partin pled no contest to numerous other corruption charges in the union, including embezzlement, and was released in 1986.[3]",
          "Testimony against Hoffa": "In 1963, Jimmy Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters, was arrested for attempted jury tampering in attempted bribery of a grand juror of a previous 1962 case involving payments from a trucking company. Partin testified that he was offered $20,000 to rig the jury in Hoffa's favor. The testimony was the primary evidence of the Justice Department that led to Hoffa being sentenced to eight years in prison.[4] The entire case rested on his testimony and he was considered the lone witness.\n\nPartin denied under oath that he was compensated by the Justice Department, but it was revealed that his ex-wife had her alimony payments given to her by the department. He originally denied that he would receive immunity or retroactive immunity for his testimony but it was later altered when he was under oath at a grand jury trial.[citation needed]\n\nJ.

          "Biography": "Perry was born in Allen, Texas, on September 3, 1929.[1][2] He was raised by his grandfather, Malcolm Oliver Perry I.[1][2] Perry graduated from Plano High School in 1947 and went on to the University of Texas at Austin. Following his school life in 1951 with a Bachelor of Arts, Perry went to Southwestern Medical School, becoming a medical doctor in 1955. Perry did his internship at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco, California, for a year, before joining the United States Air Force for two years. Perry was stationed at Geiger Field in Spokane, Washington. [citation needed]\n\nFollowing his military duties, Perry worked at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, for four years as a general surgical resident, although from September 1962 to September 1963, he traveled to the University of California at San Francisco to study vascular surgery. During that time, he became board certified by the American Board of Surgery.[citation needed]\n\nWhen President Kennedy was shot on November 22, 1963, he was taken to Parkland Hospital. Perry was one of the doctors who attended to Kennedy, performing a tracheotomy over the small wound in Kennedy's throat. Perry also rendered aid to Texas Governor John Connally, who was travelling in the car with Kennedy and was also shot.\n\nPerry stated three times at a press conference later that day that Kennedy's neck wound appeared to be an entrance wound.[citation needed] Although his statement appeared to be definitive, he had not intended it to be.[3] When interviewed by the Warren Commission, Perry said that he then believed that a \"full jacketed bullet without deformation passing through the skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and entrance wound and with the facts which you have made available and with these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit wound.\"\n\nReporter Jimmy Breslin spoke to Perry at length about his thoughts and feelings while operating on Kennedy during a November 23 press conference. Breslin wrote a story the following day that focused on Perry; Rev. Oscar Huber, who administered Kennedy's last rites; and Vernon O'Neal, who supplied a casket for Kennedy's burial. The piece, published in the New York Herald Tribune on Nov. 24, 1963, became an acclaimed classic.[4][5] Perry complained that the story got the chronology and some of the medical details wrong, but he said later, \"the major focus is correct\" and said he was touched by Breslin's \"concern and kindness\" during their interview.[6]\n\nFollowing the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby on November 24, Perry was one of the doctors to tend to Oswald. Following Oswald's death, Perry made an effort to leave the Dallas area to avoid the many press conferences and press questions. Perry left for McAllen in Hidalgo County in South Texas, the home of his mother-in-law, but he was followed there by a reporter from United Press International.\n\nPerry rarely spoke about the events of November 22, saying that it was simply a terrible day and one he chose not to talk about again.\n\nPerry later became chief of vascular surgery at Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan from 1978 to 1988. He served as a professor in the Department of Surgery at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, in the early 1990s. He was professor emeritus at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center until his death.",
          "Later life": "Perry lived in Jacksonville, Texas.[1] He died from lung cancer in Tyler, Texas on December 5, 2009.[2]",

          "Lead": "David Atlee Phillips (October 31, 1922 – July 7, 1988) was an American Central Intelligence Agency officer of 25 years and a recipient of the Career Intelligence Medal. Phillips rose to become the CIA's chief of operations for the Western Hemisphere. In 1975, he founded the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO), an alumni association comprising intelligence officers from all services.[1]\n\nPhillips was repeatedly accused of involvement in the JFK assassination. He was named by assassination researchers and even by family members of another Agency operative. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigated a claim made by Cuban exile Antonio Veciana that Phillips (while using an alias) was meeting with Lee Harvey Oswald in the months prior to November 1963. In 1980, Donald Freed and Fred Landis published a book accusing Phillips of being Oswald’s case officer, and of having a hand in the 1976 assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. Phillips sued them for libel. In 1986, they settled for an undisclosed amount and retracted the allegations.[2][3]",
          "Early life and education": "Phillips was born in Fort Worth, Texas.[4] He attended Texas Christian University in Fort Worth as well as the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[4]",
          "Career": "Phillips was an actor prior to World War II.[4] During the war, he served as a nose gunner in the United States Army Air Forces. He was shot down over Austria and captured by the Germans, but was able to escape and make his way back to Allied lines.[4]",
          "CIA career": "In 1950, Phillips joined the CIA as a part-time agent in Chile, where he owned and edited The South Pacific Mail, an English-language newspaper that circulated throughout South America and several islands in the Pacific. The CIA initially paid him a $50-a-month retainer.[5] One of his first assignments was to pose as a high-level U.S. intelligence agent who might be interested in defecting. He recalled in a 1975 interview: \"I was to be a 'dangle'. Sure enough, a KGB agent soon began to cultivate me.\"[5]\n\nHe became a full-time CIA operative in 1954, working as E. Howard Hunt’s deputy in the major psychological warfare effort in Guatemala during the U.S. coup and its aftermath.[6][7] In the weeks prior to the coup, Phillips was credited with devising a brilliant radio disinformation campaign to encourage defections within the Guatemalan military, and to create an impression among the populace that \"rebels were everywhere in Guatemala\" and that the Liberation forces were arriving imminently.[8]\n\nHe attempted a similar radio campaign in the first years of Fidel Castro's rule by broadcasting from tiny Swan Island between the Honduran and Cuban coasts. Phillips reportedly coined the phrase, \"Castro betrayed the revolution\", which was a key part of the messaging used by the anti-Castro movement.[9] Phillips assisted in planning the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961.[5] Throughout the 1960s, he was believed to be an important member of the CIA's top-secret counterintelligence group, code-named Operation 40, that sought to destabilize the Castro regime.[10]\n\nPhillips' years in the CIA also included undercover assignments in Mexico City and Beirut. He rose steadily through the ranks to intelligence officer, chief of station, and eventually chief of Western Hemisphere operations, serving primarily in Latin America, with a focus on Cuba, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic.[4][11] He retired from the agency in 1975 and founded the Association of Former Intelligence Officers in the same year.[1]",
          "House Select Committee on Assassinations": "While investigating Lee Harvey Oswald's possible ties to pro- and anti-Castro radical groups prior to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, an HSCA staff investigator, Gaeton Fonzi, reported hearing a significant anecdote from Antonio Veciana, founder of the anti-Castro paramilitary organization Alpha 66. The latter said his organization's training, funding and planning had been handled by an intelligence agent he knew as \"Maurice Bishop\". Veciana recalled a meeting with Bishop in a downtown office building in Dallas, Texas in early September 1963.[12] When Veciana arrived at the meeting, he saw Bishop in a corner of the lobby talking to a \"pale, slight\" young man.[13] The three of them exited the lobby, and Bishop and the young man continued talking out on the sidewalk. Then the young man gestured farewell to Bishop and walked away.[14] On the day of the JFK assassination, Veciana immediately recognized the news photographs and TV images of Lee Harvey Oswald as being the same young man he saw that day with Bishop in downtown Dallas.[15]\n\nAfter a former CIA officer, who had worked with Phillips at the JM/WAVE station south of Miami, told investigators that Phillips sometimes used the \"Bishop\" alias,[16] the HSCA subpoenaed Veciana to testify about Phillips as \"Bishop\". Gaeton Fonzi and Church Committee Senator Richard Schweiker were convinced that Phillips and Bishop were one and the same, but Veciana would not confirm it when shown photos of Phillips.[15] And when Veciana testified to the HSCA, he stated under oath that Phillips was not Bishop although they bore a \"physical similarity\".[17][18][19] On 25 April 1978, Phillips testified before the HSCA, and he denied ever using the name Maurice Bishop.[20] He insisted he had never met Veciana until a recent encounter arranged by Sen. Schweiker's office.[15] Then, years later at a 2014 conference entitled \"The Warren Report and the JFK Assassination: Five Decades of Significant Disclosures\", Veciana reversed his HSCA statements and asserted unequivocally, albeit not under oath, that he believed the agent he knew as Bishop was in fact David Atlee Phillips.[2][3]",
          "Conspiracy allegations and lawsuit": "In their 1980 book Death in Washington, authors Donald Freed and Fred Landis charged that the CIA was involved in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état and the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C.[21] The authors specifically named Phillips as participating in a coverup of the Letelier assassination, and reiterated Gaeton Fonzi's claim that Phillips served as Oswald's case officer while using the alias \"Maurice Bishop\".[22] In 1982, Phillips and the AFIO brought a $230 million libel suit against Freed, Landis, and their publisher.[21][22] A settlement was reached in 1986 with Phillips receiving a retraction and an undisclosed amount of money.[23] He donated the proceeds to the AFIO for the purpose of creating a legal defense fund for American intelligence officers who felt they were the victims of libel.[citation needed] In the aftermath of the lawsuit, Phillips wrote an article in Columbia Journalism Review questioning journalistic due process.[24]\n\nFollowing the death of former CIA agent and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt in 2007, two of his sons, Saint John Hunt and David Hunt, revealed that their father had recorded several \"deathbed\" admissions about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.[25][26] In the April 5, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Saint John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father, including David Atlee Phillips along with Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Sánchez Morales, Frank Sturgis, William Harvey and an assassin he termed \"French gunman grassy knoll\" who many presume was Lucien Sarti.[26][27] The two sons alleged that their father removed the controversial information from his autobiography, American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond, in order to avoid possible perjury charges.[25] Hunt's widow and other children told the Los Angeles Times that the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. The newspaper said it examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \"inconclusive.\"[25]",
          "Later life": "Phillips wrote and lectured frequently on intelligence matters. He authored numerous books, among them his CIA memoir The Night Watch, plus Careers in Secret Operations: How to Be a Federal Intelligence Officer, The Terror Brigade, The Carlos Contract, The Great Texas Murder Trials: A Compelling Account of the Sensational T. Cullen Davis Case, Secret Wars Diary: My Adventures in Combat Espionage Operations and Covert Action, and Writing For Pleasure and Profit in Retirement: How to Enjoy a Second Career as a Professional Writer.\n\nHe also compiled the David Atlee Phillips Papers, 1929-1989 and had his wife submit them to the Library of Congress after his death. These papers include manuscripts, correspondence, drafts of books, articles and other material relating to Phillips' career.",
          "Personal life": "Phillips was the brother of writer James Atlee Phillips and the uncle of musician Shawn Phillips.\n\nIn 1948, he married Helen Hausman Haasch.[28] They had four children,[5] then divorced in 1967.[28]\n\nIn 1969, he married Virginia Pederson Simmons[28] who had three children from a previous marriage. The couple had one child together.[5]",
          "Death": "Phillips died at his home in Bethesda, Maryland from complications of cancer on July 7, 1988, at the age of 65.[4] He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[29]",

          "Life and career": "Pitzer joined the Navy reserve in 1934 at the age of seventeen and trained as a Radiologic technologist. After discharge in 1939, he worked for three years as chief technologist at the Episcopal Ear, Eye and Nose Hospital. He re-enlisted in 1942 after the United States entered World War II. His obituaries listed him as \"a consultant to the visual arts department of Montgomery Junior College\".[1][2]",
          "Death": "At the time of the Kennedy assassination, Pitzer worked at the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) where Kennedy's autopsy took place. Pitzer's alleged possession of autopsy-related film and photographs is briefly discussed in the television documentary The Men Who Killed Kennedy.[3] A fellow naval officer of Pitzer's named Dennis David says that he viewed such materials in Pitzer's office at the NNMC, and that they appeared to contradict the official findings of the autopsy. At the time of his death, Pitzer held the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He was found in the NNMC television studio next to his office with a single gunshot wound to the head. Pitzer's death occurred the same day that the Kennedy family agreed, through their attorney, to release to the National Archives several items related to the autopsy of the fallen president, including photographs and x-rays.[4][5] The Naval investigation into Pitzer's death reported no evidence of foul play. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.",
          "Allegations surrounding death": "Dennis David's recollections of the autopsy and of Pitzer's materials were first made public in an anonymous 1975 interview with the Waukegan, Illinois News Sun.[6] Since that time, Pitzer's name (often accompanied by misreported circumstances of his death) has appeared in many printed or televised lists of \"suspicious deaths\" having an alleged connection to the Kennedy assassination.[7][8][page needed][9][page needed][10][page needed][11][page needed][12] Lt. Col. Dan Marvin (US Army, retired) claimed that when he saw such a list in 1993, it brought back to his memory an incident in the summer of 1965 in which he was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency to kill Pitzer.[3][13] The author who Marvin engaged to co-write a book on the subject came to have serious doubts about Marvin's story.[14] Dennis David alleged that Pitzer was left-handed but the bullet entry wound was on the right side of his head, from which David inferred that Pitzer may have been murdered. Family members have stated that Pitzer was in fact right-handed.[15] Pitzer is also sometimes said to have been present at the Kennedy autopsy at the NNMC,[7][8][12] though he was not among those noted in official records.\n\n^ \"Cmdr.

Born in the Soviet Union in 1941, she immigrated to the United States after marrying United States Marine Corps veteran Lee Harvey Oswald during his temporary defection to the Soviet Bloc. After the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Oswald's murder, Marina testified against Oswald for the Warren Commission and married American electronics worker Kenneth Jess Porter, becoming a naturalized United States citizen. She has a son with Porter and two daughters from her previous marriage with Oswald. Although Marina initially supported the Warren Commission's findings, she ultimately expressed doubts and advocated for Oswald's innocence.",
          "Early life and education": "Porter was born Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova (Russian: Марина Николаевна Прусакова) in the city of Molotovsk (now Severodvinsk), at the time in the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union and today in the Arkhangelsk Oblast of the Russian Federation. She lived there with her mother and stepfather until 1957, when she moved to Minsk in the Byelorussian SSR to live with her uncle Ilya Prusakov, who was a colonel in the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs. While in Minsk, she studied pharmacy.[2]",
          "Marriage to Lee Harvey Oswald": "Marina met Lee Harvey Oswald (a former U.S. Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union) at a dance on March 17, 1961.[3] They married six weeks later and had a daughter, June Lee Oswald, born the following year. In June 1962, the family immigrated to the United States and settled in Dallas, Texas. At a party in February 1963, George de Mohrenschildt introduced the couple to Ruth Paine, a Quaker and Russian language student.[citation needed]\n\nIn January 1963, Oswald mail-ordered a Smith & Wesson .38 revolver and then, in March, a Mannlicher–Carcano, the John F. Kennedy assassination rifle.[4] Later that month, as Marina told the Warren Commission, she took photographs of Oswald dressed in black and holding his weapons along with an issue of The Militant newspaper, which named ex-general Edwin Walker as a \"fascist.\"\n\nThese photos became known as the \"backyard photos\" of Lee Oswald, which some conspiracy theorists dismiss as fake.[5] Two photographs were later found in the garage of the Paine household. A third one was in the possession of George de Mohrenschildt.[6][7]\n\nThe photo that had been given to de Mohrenschildt was signed and dated by Lee Oswald on April 5, 1963, five days before the attempted assassination of General Walker. de Mohrenschildt eventually revealed this photograph to the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1977, shortly before committing suicide. It is similar to the photo published by LIFE magazine in early 1964, except that it has a much more extensive background. The image also has a quote in Russian, the translation of which reads, \"Hunter of Fascists, Ha-Ha-Ha!!!\"[8]\n\nIn April 1963, Marina and her daughter moved in with Ruth Paine (who had recently separated from her husband, Michael). Lee Oswald rented a separate room in Dallas and briefly moved to New Orleans during the summer of 1963. He returned to Dallas in early October, eventually renting a room in a boarding house in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas.\n\nRuth Paine learned from a neighbor that employment was available at the Texas School Book Depository, and Oswald was hired and began working there on October 16, 1963, as an order filler. On October 18, Marina and Ruth Paine had planned a birthday party for Oswald. They put up some decorations and got a birthday cake and wine. Oswald was so moved by the gesture that he had tears in his eyes. He remained emotional throughout the evening, crying and apologizing to Marina for everything he had put her through.[9] On October 20, Marina gave birth to a second daughter, Audrey Marina Rachel Oswald at Parkland Memorial Hospital.[10] Her husband continued to live in Oak Cliff on weekdays, but stayed with her at the Paine household in Irving on weekends, an arrangement that continued until Oswald was arrested for the assassination of President Kennedy.",
          "Assassination of John F. Kennedy": "Marina learned of the assassination of John F. Kennedy from the media coverage of the event and, later, of the arrest of her husband. That afternoon, Dallas Police Department detectives arrived at the Paine household, and when asked if Lee owned a rifle, Marina gestured to the garage, where Oswald stored his rifle rolled up in a blanket; no rifle was found. She was subsequently questioned both at the Paine household and later at Dallas Police Department headquarters about her husband's involvement in the death of John F. Kennedy and the murder of Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit. Marina and Oswald's mother Marguerite Oswald arrived at Dallas City Hall in the evening. Marina was shown the rifle by Carl Day and said in her statement that she was not sure whether the rifle shown to her was Lee's.[11][12]: 263–264  Captain J. W. Fritz of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau stated in a report that Marina did not positively ID the rifle.[13] On the afternoon of November 23, Marina and Marguerite talked to Lee. Marina said that when she saw her husband, he was calm, but \"by his eyes I could tell that he was afraid. He said goodbye to me with his eyes. I knew that.\"[14]\n\nMarina was widowed at age 22, on November 24, when Oswald was murdered by Jack Ruby. Marina asked to go to Parkland Hospital to see Oswald's body. She opened his eyelids and said, \"He cry, he eye wet.\"[15]\n\nMarina came to live in a hotel with business adviser, James H. Martin, who said that were \"a few threats on her life mixed with the thousands of letters of sympathy she has received\".[16] After the assassination of Kennedy and the arrest of her husband, Marina was under Secret Service protection until she completed her testimony before the Warren Commission.[17] She testified that she \"had never heard anything bad about Kennedy from Lee\" and that while in Russia, Oswald told her he would vote for Governor John Connally when he returned to the United States.[18] In her testimony, she stated her belief that her husband was guilty, an opinion she reiterated in testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, where she claimed that Oswald's motivation was not political.[19]",
          "Later life": "Following the assassination, Marina rented a house in Richardson, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, where she also found work as a drugstore clerk.[20] Donations sent to her by anonymous donors totaled about $70,000, roughly equivalent to $710,000 in 2024. She sold Lee's Russian diary for $20,000 and a picture of him holding the rifle for $5,000. She also attempted, but failed, to gain possession of the gun to sell it.[21] Marina refused to change her name and received various marriage proposals. She worried about her children and said her sympathy lay with Mrs. Kennedy, stating, \"It's hard enough to lose a bad husband...I wonder how it is to lose a good one.\" In November 1964, Marina Oswald became increasingly tense and morose, and she checked into a hospital for nervous exhaustion.[22]\n\nIn January 1965, Marina enrolled at the University of Michigan,[23] but she later returned to the Dallas area and bought a house in Richardson.[24] In 1981, Marina had Oswald's body exhumed to refute a claim that a look-alike Russian Soviet agent was buried in place of Oswald.[25] In 1989, she became a naturalized United States citizen.[26]",
          "Marriage to Kenneth Jess Porter": "On June 1, 1965, she and electronics worker Kenneth Jess Porter travelled to Fate, Texas, and were wed by a justice of the peace.[27] They had a son.[28] She later accused Kenneth of domestic violence.[24] Marina moved to Rockwall, Texas, with her husband and family, and they generally avoided publicity.[29][30][31][32][33][34] On October 8, 2024, Kenneth died in their family home at the age of 86.[35]",
          "Support for Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories": "Though she has not formally recanted any of her Warren Commission testimony, stating that she wanted to initially deny the possibility of her husband's guilt,[36][37][38] Marina has said, in various interviews since the late 1980s, that she came to believe that Oswald was completely innocent of the murders of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit, and that she believed Oswald worked for the government.[26][39][40][41] Jim Martin, her manager, said that he felt that despite her testifying against him, he felt that she did not \"really think she thought he was guilty\".[42] Jim Leavelle, the Dallas Police detective who was handcuffed to Oswald when Ruby shot him, had several meals from time to time with Marina and said that Marina would \"sound him out\" to see if he had any doubts on Oswald's guilt.[43] In 2018, Marina was contacted for the theory that the unidentified \"prayer man\" filmed on the steps of the Texas School Book Depository during the assassination by Dave Wiegman, Jr., of NBC, and James Darnell, of WBAP-TV, was Oswald. Ed Ledoux phoned Marina after Stan Dane had sent enlargements of the Darnell and Wiegman films showing the \"prayer man\" figure. An unprompted Marina volunteered, \"It's Lee\".[44] She maintains her belief that Oswald was the \"prayer man\".[citation needed]\n\nMarina's daughters also gave a few interviews, in which they expressed scepticism regarding Oswald's guilt though they also say they just want to know the truth.[45][46] In a 1995 interview with the New York Times, June Oswald, the Oswald's oldest child, said when asked on the matter of her father's guilt or innocence: \"It would make a difference in the sense of justice being served. If the truth can be found that shows Lee had nothing to do with the assassination, I would feel better in that there have been a lot of things said and done regarding my family that all proceeded from an erroneous perception of what he did or didn't do.\"[47]\n\n^ Granberry, Michael (November 9, 2013). \"As paparazzi stalk her, Kennedy assassin's widow lives quiet Dallas-area life\".

          "Lead": "Frank Ragano (January 25, 1923 – May 13, 1998) was a self-styled \"mob lawyer\" from Florida, who made his name representing organized crime figures such as Santo Trafficante, Jr. and Carlos Marcello, and also served as lawyer for Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa. In his 1994 autobiography Mob Lawyer, Ragano recounted his career in defending members of organized crime, and made the controversial allegation that Florida mob boss Santo Trafficante, Jr. confessed to him shortly before he died in 1987 that he and Carlos Marcello had arranged for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.",
          "Early life": "Born in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida to Sicilian parents,[1] Ragano attended Stetson Law School and clerked for the Florida Supreme Court before admission to the Florida Bar in 1952 and beginning his trial practice in Tampa, Florida.[2] In 1954, he was recruited by another attorney to represent several defendants arrested in Tampa for involvement in Santo Trafficante, Jr.'s illegal bolita operations.[3] He immediately befriended Trafficante, who thereafter welcomed him into the inner circles of Florida's organized crime scene.\n\nRagano became a frequent visitor to Trafficante's Havana nightclubs. During one such visit, Trafficante told Ragano that in 1957 he and others had set up then Senator John F. Kennedy in a Havana hotel room with several prostitutes, and that Trafficante rued the day he had failed to preserve the moment in secret surveillance tapes that could have been used for bribery purposes.[4]\n\nIn 1959, after Fidel Castro overthrew the Fulgencio Batista regime in Cuba, Trafficante's casinos were closed down and he was imprisoned by the new government. Ragano worked on various attempts to free Trafficante, who was ultimately released in early 1960 and returned to the United States.[5]",
          "Hoffa and Marcello": "By 1960, Ragano was already known as a shrewd, up-and-coming criminal defense attorney, who defended a wide range of clients. Thanks to a recommendation from Santo Trafficante, Ragano was hired by Jimmy Hoffa to represent him on union corruption charges, thus beginning a long association with the infamous labor leader.[6] He used his position with Hoffa to help place loans from the Teamsters' pension funds in return for \"finder's fees.\" Liberace, the entertainer, was one such client who attempted to get a Teamsters' loan.[7] Ragano witnessed millions of dollars of kickbacks to Hoffa from the Teamsters' pension fund.[8]\n\nIn 1963, again on Trafficante's recommendation, Ragano began serving as attorney for Carlos Marcello, the head of the New Orleans crime family.[9] In his book, Ragano claimed that Hoffa, who was being hounded by United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on corruption and jury tampering charges, asked him to convey a message to Trafficante and Marcello that an assassination of President Kennedy should be arranged.[10]\n\nWhen Kennedy was shot and killed later that year, Ragano wrote that Hoffa always assumed that Trafficante and Marcello had actually carried out such a plan.[11] Trafficante did \"celebrate\" with Ragano upon hearing word of Kennedy's assassination, but made no admission to Ragano at that time that he was in any way involved.[12] He did tell Ragano later that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had once asked him for help in assassinating Castro in Cuba.[13]\n\nIn 1975, Ragano was asked by Trafficante to convey an urgent message to Hoffa to \"be very careful and not take any chances.\"[14] Within days, Hoffa disappeared under mysterious circumstances, never to be found.",
          "Later life": "In 1966, while representing Trafficante in connection with an arrest of several top mobsters in New York City, Ragano was photographed having lunch with Trafficante, Marcello, and others, and was identified by Time magazine as a \"top Cosa Nostra hoodlum.\"[15] He later sued Time for libel[16] and was represented by famed trial lawyer Melvin Belli. During the libel trial he was called \"house counsel for the mob.\"[17] He lost his suit.[18] Belli had previously represented Jack Ruby, the man who killed Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused killer of Kennedy, and Ragano claimed that Trafficante warned him not to ask Belli any questions about Ruby.[19]\n\nIn connection with an incident made famous in the Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas, Ragano helped represent four mobsters, including \"Jimmy the Gent\" Burke and Henry Hill, charged in 1972 with extortion in collecting a gambling debt in Tampa, Florida.[20]\n\nRagano himself became the accused when he was charged with tax evasion in 1972. Although his conviction was reversed on appeal, he was later retried and convicted on related charges.[21] As a result, he was suspended from the practice of law in 1976, and claims that Trafficante provided no support and abandoned him.[22]\n\nIn 1978, Ragano testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, which was reinvestigating the John F. Kennedy assassination, and denied involvement in any JFK plots.[23] In 1981, Ragano was reinstated as an attorney by The Florida Bar, and eventually made amends with Trafficante, whom he then represented in 1986 in a racketeering case also made famous in the film Donnie Brasco. Trafficante, who was also represented by others, was acquitted of all charges.[24]\n\nIn 1990, Ragano was again convicted of tax evasion.[25] In 1993, he served 10 months in prison.[26] On May 13, 1998, in Tampa, Frank Ragano died in his sleep. He was survived by his second wife (former mistress) and their two children, and his first wife and their three children.[8] In 1995, the A&E Network aired an episode of American Justice devoted to his career as a \"defender of the mob.\"[27]\n\nRagano died peacefully in his sleep on May 13, 1998, in his home in Tampa, Florida.",
          "Mob Lawyer": "In 1994, Ragano's autobiography Mob Lawyer was published by Charles Scribner's Sons.[8][28] The book was co-written with Selwyn Raab, a reporter for The New York Times.[8][28]\n\nKirkus Reviews described Mob Lawyer as a \"riveting memoir of life inside the murderous world of Mafia chieftain Santo Trafficante and Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa, by their personal lawyer\" and an \"insider's impossible-to-put-down account of life within the 'Honorable Society.'\"[29] In a review for ABA Journal, Martin Kimel called it an \"intelligent memoir\" and wrote: \"Despite the seaminess of its cast of characters, Mob Lawyer is engrossing reading and an object lesson in lifestyles of the rich and infamous.\"[28]\n\nPublishers Weekly said: \"The story, which profits from the smooth style of New York Times crime reporter Raab, has less impact as an account of a man who woke up too late than for its revelations about significant events of our time.\"[30] Ronald Goldfarb reviewed the book for The Washington Post stating: \"Ragano's biography of his career is full of naive rationalizations about the virtues of these men he cavorted with and represented..., and self-serving criticism of the government's Gestapo-like tactics, selective prosecution, use of spies as witnesses and intimidation of suspects' families.\"[31] Goldfarb added, \"Cynics will wonder whether Mob Lawyer is merely the latest entry in the books-by-crooks genre. Except for the shocking disclosures about his deceased former clients, there is no reason to read this book. With them, however, it joins a select few that provide critical links in the circumstantial case that the mob planned JFK’s killing.\"[31]",
          "JFK assassination claims": "On January 14, 1992, Ragano told Jack Newfield of the New York Post that he relayed a request from Hoffa to Trafficante and Marcello asking that the two Mafia bosses kill Kennedy.[32] He repeated the claim two days later on ABC's Good Morning America,[33] in Newfield's Frontline report entitled JFK, Hoffa and Mob broadcast in November 1992,[34] and again in his 1994 autobiography Mob Lawyer.[8]\n\nAccording to Ragano, he met Hoffa at the Teamsters' headquarters in Washington D.C. then delivered the message to Trafficante and Marcello a few days later in a meeting at the Royal Orleans Hotel in New Orleans.[32][33] He stated he was chosen by Hoffa because, as both Hoffa and Trafficante's lawyer, he could be assured of attorney–client privilege.[32] Ragano said that Jim Garrison served as a patsy for the New Orleans mob by disseminating theories that served to distract attention from mafia figures who were involved in the plot.[35]\n\nAlthough Ragano believed he had received a few hints from both Trafficante and Marcello that they had somehow been involved in the Kennedy assassination, it was not until just before he died in 1987 that Trafficante, according to Ragano, made a direct confession to him. Ragano wrote that on March 13, 1987, a dying Trafficante (he died four days later) asked to meet him in Tampa for a hurried meeting. While riding in Ragano's car, Trafficante allegedly told Ragano in Sicilian: \"Carlos e' futtutu. Non duvevamu ammazzari a Giovanni. Duvevamu ammazzari a Bobby,\" which Ragano translated as: \"Carlos screwed up. We shouldn't have killed John. We should have killed Bobby.\"[36] Ragano stated three witnesses could support his statement that he met Trafficante in Tampa.[37] He refused to name them adding: \"One guy is afraid of retaliation. The other guys are two doctors, who say they'll testify if they're summoned to court.\"[37]\n\nIn his book Reclaiming History: the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Vincent Bugliosi has pointed out many flaws in Ragano's claims, including the fact that Trafficante was most likely not in Tampa on the day in question, but was rather in North Miami Beach receiving dialysis treatments.[38] Bugliosi argues that it is absurd to think that Marcello and Trafficante would get involved in plotting to assassinate a president, particularly as nothing more than a supposed favor to Jimmy Hoffa.[39] Bugliosi also points out that by allegedly conveying a message in 1963 to that effect, and by relating this confession from an alleged conspirator, Ragano would himself be admitting to having been a part of a murder conspiracy.[40]\n\nShortly after the initial allegations, Jeffrey Hart compared Ragano's account with that presented in Oliver Stone's recently released film JFK.[41] According to Hart, Ragano presented an \"earthy motive, vastly more plausible than the movie theory.\"[41] Hart quoted G. Robert Blakey as stating that he believed Ragano and that his testimony \"would have strengthened the conclusions\" of the HSCA.[41] Hart also quoted Frank Mankiewicz, Robert F. Kennedy's press secretary, as finding Ragano's scenario as \"the most plausible (assassination) theory\".[41]\n\nWhen Ragano was questioned by the Assassination Records Review Board, created in 1992 to reexamine JFK conspiracy theories after the release of Stone's film, he claimed to have contemporaneous notes of his conversations regarding the JFK plot, but when they were produced, \"he could not definitively state whether the notes were taken during the meetings [with mob figures]... or later when he was working on his book.\" His notes were subjected to Secret Service tests to determine when they were actually prepared, but the results were inconclusive.[42]",
          "Billie Jean King-Bobby Riggs Allegations": "In August, 2013, The Tampa Tribune newspaper and ESPN published allegations by a former employee of the Palma Ceia Country Club in Tampa, claiming that in 1973 an employee overheard Ragano, Trafficante and Marcello discussing plans by Bobby Riggs to throw the famed tennis match with female tennis star Billie Jean King.[43] That year, Riggs and King held a nationally televised tennis match called \"The Battle of the Sexes,\" in which King beat Riggs in three straight sets after Riggs had taunted female tennis players and had beaten Margaret Court. According to Hal Shaw, a former employee of the Palma Ceia Golf & Country Club (an exclusive private club near downtown Tampa, Florida), he overheard Ragano tell Trafficante and Marcello that Riggs owed over $100,000 to the mob, and that in exchange for throwing the match his debt would be absolved.[43]\n\nSelwyn Raab, who co-authored Mob Lawyer with Ragano, when told of these allegations, stated that no mention was ever made by Ragano about this in any of his notes or in the FBI files. \"It's kind of a good story. I don't think (Ragano) would have excluded it.\"[43]\n\nChris Ragano, a Tampa attorney and son of Frank Ragano from his second marriage to his mistress Nancy, responded to the allegations by stating that the Ragano family did not move to Tampa until 1979. That is clearly not true as the Frank Ragano's original family had been in the Tampa Bay area since the early 1950s and Frank was born in Tampa. In 1974, Frank Ragano was convicted on 5 separate tax fraud charges[44] Further, Hal Shaw's recollection that he gave tennis lessons to Frank Ragano's wife was not confirmed by Mrs. Ragano, who has no recollection of any such lessons in Tampa. Trafficante and Marcello were not known to frequent the Palma Ceia Country Club, preferring meetings at Malio's Steakhouse in Tampa or La Tropicana Cafe in Ybor City to discuss mob business.[43]\n\nIn 2016, Robert J. Cipriano obtained the film rights to Mob Lawyer from Ragano's wife Nancy and son Chris. Cipriano was introduced to Ragano by Thomas Lipscomb of the New York Times Book Review in early 1986, while Cipriano was producing film and televisions projects with Parkinson Friendly Productions in Los Angeles, California.",

          "Biography": "Nagell entered the US Army in 1948, served in two tours of duty in the Korean War with the 24th Infantry Division where he was awarded three Purple Hearts [2] and was honourably discharged with the rank of Captain in 1959. In November 1954 he was the sole survivor of an airplane crash that left him with facial injuries.[3]\n\nNagell was arrested on September 20, 1963 after he entered the State National Bank in El Paso, Texas and fired two shots into the ceiling of the bank. Nagell walked out of the bank after firing his weapon and sat down and waited for the police to arrive. [4] Dick Russell's biography of Nagell claims that Nagell had foreknowledge of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.[5] According to Russell, Nagell also claimed to have gotten himself arrested in the El Paso bank shooting in late September 1963 to avoid becoming a patsy.[6] Nagell met with New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who at the time was investigating Clay Shaw's possible complicity in the assassination.[7]",
          "Death": "Nagell died from heart disease on November 1, 1995, in Los Angeles, California. His death occurred one day after the Assassination Records Review Board had sent him a letter for information.[5][1] He was 65 years old at the time of his death and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[1][8]",

          "Lead": "Charles Frederick Rogers (December 30, 1921[1] – disappeared June 23, 1965) was an American seismologist, pilot, and murder suspect who disappeared in June 1965 after police discovered the dismembered bodies of his elderly parents in the refrigerator of the Houston home all three shared, in what the media later dubbed \"The Icebox Murders\".[2] Rogers has never been found and was declared dead in absentia in July 1975. He remains the only suspect in the murders, which are still considered unsolved.",
          "Background and education": "Charles Rogers enrolled at Texas A&M University in 1942, but later dropped out.[3] He then enrolled at the University of Houston, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear physics. During World War II, Rogers was a pilot in the United States Navy and also served in the Office of Naval Intelligence.[4] After the war, he worked as a seismologist for Shell Oil for nine years.[1] He abruptly quit his job in 1957 without giving an explanation.[3]\n\nFriends and associates of Rogers later said that he was highly intelligent and had a talent for finding gas, oil and gold for the companies for which he worked. He also spoke seven languages and had an interest in ham radios.[5] In the mid-1950s, Rogers joined the Civil Air Patrol, where he reportedly met David Ferrie, an alleged conspirator in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.[6]",
          "Murders and disappearance": "By 1965, Rogers was unemployed and living with his elderly parents, Fred Christopher (born January 19, 1884) and Edwina Ivor Rogers (born October 8, 1892), in the Montrose neighborhood of Houston.[3] Described as \"reclusive\",[4][7] Rogers was reported to have communicated with his parents by way of notes slipped under the door. Neighbors were unaware that Rogers lived with his parents as he generally left the home before dawn and did not return until after dark.[3]\n\nOn June 23, 1965, two Houston police officers were dispatched to the Rogers’ home to conduct a welfare check after Edwina's nephew Marvin reported that his phone calls to his aunt had gone unanswered for days. After receiving no answering after knocking, the officers forced their way into the Rogers’ home. Upon entering, the officers found nothing unusual but noticed food sitting on the dining room table.[8] One officer opened the refrigerator and found what appeared to be numerous cuts of washed, unwrapped meat neatly stacked on the shelves.[3] The officer later recalled that he thought the meat was that of a butchered hog.[9] As the officer was closing the door, he noticed two human heads visible through the clear glass of the vegetable bin.[10] The heads were those of Fred and Edwina Rogers. What the officer initially thought were unwrapped cuts of hog meat were the couple's dismembered limbs and torsos.[3] Police later discovered the couple's organs in a nearby sewer (the organs had been removed, cut up and flushed down the toilet) while other remains were never found.[4]\n\nPolice determined that Fred and Edwina Rogers had been killed on June 20, Father's Day.[5] An autopsy showed that Fred was bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer.[3] His eyes had been gouged out and his genitalia were removed. Edwina had been beaten and shot, execution style, in the head.[5] Police further said that the bodies were dismembered in the upstairs bathroom by a person \"with some knowledge of anatomy\". There was little blood in the house and it appeared it had been thoroughly cleaned after the murders.[3] What little blood was found led to Charles' bedroom. There, police found a bloodstained keyhole saw but no trace of Rogers himself.[2] A search for Rogers was launched and a warrant was issued for him as a material witness to the crime, but he was never found.[11]",
          "Allegations of involvement in the assassination of JFK": "Rogers' life was documented in the 1992 book The Man on the Grassy Knoll by John R. Craig and Philip A. Rogers.[4][7] According to this work, Rogers was a CIA agent who was postulated to have impersonated Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City and, along with Charles Harrelson, was one of two shooters involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.[4][2][7][12] The authors contend that Rogers, Harrelson, and Chauncey Holt were the \"three tramps\" arrested in Dealey Plaza after the assassination, and that Rogers murdered his parents because his mother was tracking his many telephone calls.[4][7][12] In this account, Rogers fled to Guatemala.[13] Publishers Weekly reviewed the book stating: \"The authors do a workmanlike job with their thesis, but the degree of poetic license, in terms of reconstructed dialogue and attributed thought, seems excessive here, and sourcing is virtually nonexistent. Assassination buffs, however, will welcome the book for its novelty value and its easy readability.\"[7]",
          "Aftermath": "In 1975, a Houston judge declared Rogers legally dead so his estate could be probated.[9] The case still remains officially unsolved and Rogers remains the only suspect.[5]\n\nHouston forensic accountant Hugh Gardenier and his wife Martha have continued to investigate the case and concluded that Rogers did murder his parents and was later killed in Honduras.[13] While they have dismissed John R. Craig and Philip A. Rogers's claim that Rogers was a CIA operative due to a lack of evidence, they admit that Rogers did have dealings with contract workers for the CIA when he worked as a seismologist.\n\nThe Gardeniers believe that Rogers planned the murder of his parents for years because his father was abusive and both parents were \"devious con artists\". According to them, Fred worked as a bookie who regularly engaged in illegal activities such as gambling and fraud. They believe he continued abusing Charles into adulthood and began stealing large sums of money from him.[5] The Gardeniers claim that after Rogers killed and dismembered his parents, he fled the U.S. for Mexico and was never found because he was aided by \"powerful friends\" he met through his ham radio hobby and while working for various oil and mining companies.[5] They have theorized that Rogers eventually made his way to Honduras, where he was killed over a wage dispute with miners.[14]\n\nIn October 2003, Redbud Publishing released The Ice Box Murders, a novel written by the Gardeniers.[15] According to a review in the Houston Press: \"The Ice Box Murders is written as fact-based fiction and supposition. There are many unnamed characters in the book: various politicians and attorneys as well as the eyewitness who said he saw Rogers in Honduras after 1965.\"[14] Publishers Weekly also referred to the novel as \"fact-based fiction\".[15]\n\nThe house in which the murders took place was located at 1815 Driscoll Street. After the murders, the house remained empty and unsold. It was torn down in 1972. The lot remained empty until 2000 when condominiums were built on the lot.[5]",
          "In popular culture": "Rogers is featured in two novels by James Ellroy: American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand.[2]\n\nThe murder case involving Rogers, as well as Hugh and Martha Gardenier looking into the case, is the subject of Episode 41 of the Criminal podcast, titled \"Open Case\".[16]\n\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\n\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\n\n^\na b Benson, Michael (1993).

          "Lead": "Earl Forrest Rose (September 23, 1926 – May 1, 2012) was an American forensic pathologist, professor of medicine, and lecturer of law.[1] Rose was the medical examiner for Dallas County, Texas, at the time of the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy and he performed autopsies on J. D. Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Jack Ruby.[1][2][3][4] After being shoved by Kennedy's aides, he stepped aside and allowed Kennedy's body to be removed from Parkland Memorial Hospital without performing an autopsy.[4]",
          "Early life": "Rose was born in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, on September 23, 1926, to Forest—a cowboy and rodeo rider— and Lena Berghuis Rose.[1][2][3] He grew up on a remote ranch 26 miles from Eagle Butte on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.[1][2] Rose was reported to have ridden his horse five miles to get to school.[3] According to his memoirs, he attended \"one room country grade schools\" before going to high school in Eagle Butte.[5]\n\nIn the spring of 1944, at the end of his junior year, the 17-year-old Rose dropped out of high school and enlisted in the United States Navy where he served on a submarine, the USS Sea Devil, in the Pacific theater of World War II.[1][2][3] According to Rose, at the end of hostilities his boat moored in Shanghai and Qingdao, China, and served as a \"military presence\" patrolling the China Seas.[5]\n\nHe was discharged from the Navy in 1946, then attended Yankton College from which he graduated with a B.A. 1949.[1][3][5] While at Yankton, he met Marilyn Preheim, who was a medical tech student at a nearby hospital.[2] The couple married in the Mennonite Church on July 28, 1951, and eventually had a son and five daughters.[1][2][3][5]\n\nRose studied medicine for two years at the University of South Dakota, then earned his M.D. from the University of Nebraska in 1953.[1][3][5] In the mid-1950s, he interned in Denver, Colorado, worked in private practice in Lemmon, South Dakota, then completed specialty training with residencies at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas (surgical pathology) and DePaul Hospital in St. Louis (clinical pathology).[3][5] Rose then sub-specialized with a fellowship in forensic pathology at the Medical College of Virginia.[3][5] He worked as a forensic pathologist in Virginia where he held the title of Deputy Chief Examiner for the Tidewater Region of Virginia.[1][5]\n\nIn June 1963, Rose moved to Dallas where he became medical examiner for the city and county of Dallas.[3][5] According to The New York Times, he was \"hired by the county to establish a scientifically valid medical examiner’s system to replace its existing system of elected lay coroners.\"[3] While working as a medical examiner in Dallas, Rose received a law degree from Southern Methodist University.[3]",
          "John F. Kennedy": "On November 22, 1963, Rose was in his office at Parkland Memorial Hospital across the corridor from Trauma Room 1 when he received word that Kennedy was pronounced dead.[4] He walked across the corridor to the trauma room occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy and a priest who had been called in to administer last rites.[4] There, Rose was met by Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman and Kennedy's personal physician George Burkley who told him that there was no time for an autopsy because Mrs. Kennedy would not leave Dallas without her husband's body which was to be delivered promptly to the airport.[4]\n\nAt the time of the assassination, the murder of a United States President was not a federal crime.[2] Rose objected, insisting that Texas law required him to perform a post-mortem examination prior to the removal of the body.[2][4] A heated exchange ensued as he argued with Kennedy's aides.[2][4] Kennedy's body was placed in a casket and, accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy, rolled down the corridor on a gurney.[4] Rose was reported to have stood in a hospital doorway, backed by a policeman, in an attempt to prevent the removal of the coffin.[2][4]\n\nAccording to Robert Caro's The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power, the President's aides \"had literally shoved [Rose] and the policeman aside to get out of the building.\"[4] In an interview with Journal of the American Medical Association, Rose stated that he stepped aside feeling that it was unwise to exacerbate the tension.[4]\n\nRose received criticism for arguing with federal officials at Parkland.[6] For his role in the immediate aftermath of the assassination, he was disparaged by William Manchester in his 1967 book The Death of a President.[2] Describing Manchester's portrayal of Rose, Peter Knight wrote: \"If Dallas and Oswald are the overt culprits of the crime, then Earl Rose is the cameo villain of the book.\"[7] According to a 2003 AP report, Rose's son, Forrest, believed that the book \"depicted [Rose] as an unreasonable, petty state bureaucrat with a gripe.\"[6] BMJ wrote that he was \"portrayed almost comically as a small time official trying to act important; a portrayal most now see as unjustified.\"[4]\n\nIn a 1992 interview published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Rose said, \"The law was broken\" and that \"[a] Texas autopsy would have assured a tight chain of custody on all the evidence.\"[1] In 2003, Rose said he still believed that he and his staff should have been allowed to perform the post-mortem examination of Kennedy and that many conspiracy theories about the assassination would have been quelled had he examined the President.[6]",
          "J. D. Tippit": "Rose began his autopsy of Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit at 3:14 pm on November 22.[8] He found bullet entrance wounds on the officer's body: two on the right side of his chest, one in his right temple, and a superficial wound to his left rib.[8] Rose removed the three bullets that had entered Tippit's chest and head, noting that there was massive hemorrhaging as a result of penetration of the lung and liver, as well as a large amount of damage to his brain.[8]",
          "Lee Harvey Oswald": "Two days after the assassination of Kennedy, Rose was called out of church to tend to Oswald, who had been fatally shot by Jack Ruby.[2] Announcing the results of the gross autopsy, Rose said: \"The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male.\"[9] His examination found that Ruby's bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.[9]\n\nIn 1979, Michael Eddowes—who wrote a book claiming that the man who assassinated Kennedy was a look-alike of Oswald put in place by Soviet secret police—filed suit in Fort Worth, Texas, in order to exhume Oswald's body for verification of its identity. There was reported to have been some controversy regarding Rose's measurement of Oswald's height and that he did not note a mastoidectomy scar which was claimed to exist by others.[10] Rose said he did not object to the exhumation. He was reported to have met Eddowes and to have had \"great respect\" for him.[10]",
          "Jack Ruby": "On January 3, 1967, Ruby, the murderer of Oswald, died at Parkland Hospital.[11] Rose began the autopsy on Ruby an hour after his death, and a report released the following month indicated that three doctors from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School assisted him in the post-mortem examination.[12] The cause of death was determined to be a lung obstruction due to a massive blood clot.[12] Rose was quoted as saying that the clot originated in one of Ruby's legs and traveled through his heart to the lungs.[11]\n\nAfter what was initially thought to be pneumonia, Ruby was diagnosed with cancer at Parkland in December 1966.[13] Rose indicated that the same type of cancer that affected Ruby's lungs was found in his brain, lymph nodes, liver, pancreas, pleura, ribs, and vertebra.[13] He said that eight tumors were found in his brain, with the largest being three-fourths of an inch.[13]\n\nRose told reporters that he could not definitively answer whether or not the tumors were present in Ruby's brain at the time he shot Oswald, but he indicated metastasis from the lungs to the brain could not have occurred prior to 1964 since X-rays at the county jail that year revealed that his lungs were clear.[13] He added that he found no evidence of epilepsy or other brain abnormalities.[13] Rose stated that his death certificate would note cancer as a contributing cause, but that the clot would likely have killed Ruby even if he had not been weakened by cancer.[11]",
          "Later life": "In 1966, Rose performed autopsies on the crew of American Flyers Flight 280 and testified about his findings in a hearing before the Civil Aeronautics Board.[14]\n\nFrom 1968 until his retirement in early 1992, Rose taught pathology at the University of Iowa.[3] He was an expert witness in the 1977 trial of Robert Williams, who was indicted for the first-degree murder of 10-year-old Pamela Powers.[15] In 1978, he served on the Forensic Pathology Panel of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations.[16][17] During their retirement, Rose and his wife worked as small claims court mediators in Johnson County, Iowa.[2]\n\nSuffering from late-onset dementia and Parkinson's disease, Rose lost his long-term memory and the ability to converse over the last year of his life.[2] He contracted a near-fatal case of pneumonia and was bed-ridden prior to his death.[2] On May 1, 2012, Rose died at the Oaknoll Retirement Residence in Iowa City, Iowa from complications due to Parkinson's disease.[1][3]",
          "Views": "Rose rejected the idea that there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and he supported the Warren Commission's conclusion that a single gunman shot the President.[3] The New York Times characterized him as \"an outspoken opponent of capital punishment\".[3] According to The Des Moines Register, Rose described himself as a \"'visitor' to the Mennonite faith\".[2]\n\nJohn F.

Roselli was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a plot to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro.[1]",
          "Early life": "Roselli was born Filippo Sacco on July 4, 1905, in Esperia, Lazio, Italy.[2] His father, Vincenzo Sacco, had moved to the United States first, followed by Filippo at the age of six, who had immigrated with his mother, Mariantonia Pascale Sacco, to Boston, Massachusetts.[2] His father died in 1918.[3]",
          "1920s": "In September 14, 1922, Sacco was arrested on narcotics charges in Massachusetts.[4] He first fled to New York for three months,[2] before moving on to Chicago, where he changed his name from Filippo Sacco to John Roselli.[4]\n\nRoselli moved to Los Angeles in 1924, pleading guilty to bootlegging that same year.[5][6] Roselli began his California criminal career working for small-time bootleggers, becoming the top truck driver for Tony Cornero. Eventually, Roselli was promoted to working closely with the Cornero brothers to secure liquor imports into Southern California. He was especially important in bribing and securing the loyalty of Orange County officials, opening up their ports for the gang's use. In 1926, Tony Cornero fled to Canada, escaping a two-year bootlegging sentence. As a result of the gang's dissolution, Roselli went independent. He became further involved in several L.A.-area vice rackets, especially prostitution and gambling.[7]\n\nRoselli first met Al Capone in 1927, on a trip to Chicago to attend the Jack Dempsey-Gene Tunney boxing match. Capone was holding a party that night at his headquarters, Metropole Hotel, where Johnny could briefly meet him and the Chicago Outfit's inner circle. Roselli next met with Capone at the Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. In 1928, Capone invited Roselli to Chicago, offering him a role in his organization. Roselli was tasked with working with the Los Angeles crime family, to monitor Capone's investments and facilitate cooperation between the L.A. and Chicago organizations. The Los Angeles branch of the Mafia was at the time under the leadership of Joseph Ardizzone, and Roselli worked closely with Ardizonne's underboss, Jack Dragna.[7]\n\nDuring this time, Roselli was involved with Los Angeles' offshore gambling racket. He led the mob's hostile takeover of the gambling ship Monfalcone. Roselli's underworld activities sometimes had to be put on hold while he dealt with long bouts of tuberculosis.[7]\n\nRoselli became close friends with film producer Bryan Foy, who brought Roselli into the movie business as a producer with Foy's small production company, Eagle Lion Studios, where Roselli is credited on several early gangster movies as a producer. Roselli was also close friends with Columbia Pictures co-founder Harry Cohn.[7]",
          "1930s": "In 1931, L.A. Mafia boss Joseph Ardizzone survived two assassination attempts and declared he would retire. Instead, he disappeared in October 1931 and Jack Dragna took his place as Don.\n\nIn July 1933, Frank L. Shaw began his term as the Los Angeles mayor. He established a corrupt administration where the city's underworld paid regular bribes directly to city hall. Roselli used his position in L.A.'s Mafia and deep knowledge of the city's underworld to make himself the liaison between the mayor's office and the various gangs and individuals who sent regular payoffs to city hall. This favored position with the city government helped to position Jack Dragna's organization as the preeminent criminal organization in Los Angeles under the Shaw administration.[7]",
          "1940s–1950s": "During this period, Roselli's lawyer was Frank DeSimone; secretly a mob member, DeSimone became the L.A. mob boss when Jack Dragna died in 1956.\n\nIn 1942, Roselli was indicted on federal labor racketeering charges, along with George Brown, former president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union, and Willie Bioff, labor racketeer and former pimp. Later in 1942, Roselli enlisted in the United States Army, where he served for three years before receiving an undesirable discharge.[8] It was while in the service that Roselli was convicted of the extortion scheme to extort money from Hollywood figures, in 1943, serving a prison sentence until his release in 1947.[8]\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Roselli shifted his focus away from Hollywood and toward the fast-growing and highly profitable gambling mecca, Las Vegas. By 1956, Roselli had become the Chicago and Los Angeles mob's chief representative in Las Vegas. His job was to ensure that the Chicago mob bosses received their share of the burgeoning casino revenues through \"skimming\". However, according to the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Roselli was employed as a movie producer at Monogram Studios.[3]",
          "1960s": "After the Cuban Revolution in January 1959, Fidel Castro closed down the casinos that the mob operated in Cuba, and attempted to drive the mobsters out of the country.[9] This made Roselli, Chicago Outfit boss Sam Giancana and Tampa Mafia boss Santo Trafficante amenable to the idea of killing Castro.\n\nAccording to the Family Jewels documents released in 2007, members of the Mafia were involved in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)'s attempts to assassinate Castro.[10] Roselli had a particular contempt for Castro and felt in some way responsible for the Bay of Pigs invasion failure as he had encouraged individuals to take part.[11] The documents showed that, in September 1960, the CIA recruited Robert Maheu, an ex-FBI agent and aide to Howard Hughes in Las Vegas, to approach Roselli under the pretense of representing international corporations that wanted Castro dead due to lost gambling interests.[10] Roselli introduced Maheu to mob leaders Sam Giancana and Santo Trafficante. Supplied with six poison pills from the CIA, Giancana and Trafficante tried unsuccessfully to have people place the poison in Castro's food.[10] Further attempts were canceled soon thereafter due to the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961.[10][12]\n\nIn 1963, singer Frank Sinatra sponsored Roselli for membership in the exclusive Los Angeles Friar's Club. Soon after his acceptance, Roselli discovered an elaborate card-cheating operation run by one of his Las Vegas friends, Maurice Friedman, and asked for his cut. The card cheating was finally discovered in July 1967 by FBI agents tailing Roselli.[3] Scores of wealthy men, including millionaire Harry Karl, the husband of actress Debbie Reynolds, and actor Zeppo Marx, were bilked out of millions of dollars. Grant B. Cooper represented some of the defendants in the case, including Roselli. Roselli was eventually convicted and fined $55,000. During the trial, secret grand jury transcripts were discovered on the defense attorney's table. Cooper eventually pleaded guilty to contempt for possessing the documents.[13]\n\nIn the 1960s, Immigration and Naturalization Service had also tried to deport Roselli, although were unsuccessful.[2]",
          "1970s": "On June 24 and September 22, 1975, Roselli testified before the 1975 U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCIA) led by Idaho Senator Frank Church about the CIA plan to kill Castro, Operation Mongoose. Shortly before Roselli testified, an unknown person shot and killed Giancana in the basement of his Illinois home. This happened just days before Giancana was to testify before the committee. Giancana's murder supposedly prompted Roselli to permanently leave Los Angeles and Las Vegas for Miami.\n\nOn April 23, 1976, Roselli was called before the committee to testify about a conspiracy to kill President John F. Kennedy.[3] Three months after his first round of testimony on the Kennedy assassination, the Committee wanted to recall Roselli. However, at this point, he had been missing since July 28.[14] On August 3, Tennessee Senator Howard Baker, a member of the new SSCIA, requested that the FBI investigate Roselli's disappearance.[3]",
          "Death": "On August 7, 1976, ten days after his disappearance, Roselli's decomposing body was found by a fisherman in a 55-gallon steel fuel drum floating in Dumfoundling Bay near Miami.[15] [16] He died of asphyxiation.[16] Federal investigators suggested he may have been killed by Chicago mobsters for keeping an unfair share of the mob's gambling interests in Las Vegas.[16] At the behest of some members of the United States Senate, United States Attorney General Edward H. Levi instructed the FBI to find out if Roselli's earlier testimony regarding the CIA plot to assassinate Castro may have led to his murder.[16] The FBI investigation summarized that Roselli was killed by Frank \"The German\" Schweihs, Vincent Incerro and two other suspects. The contract was sanctioned by the Chicago Outfit's consigliere, Tony Accardo, because \"Roselli was becoming a public source of embarrassment to La Cosa Nostra\".[17]",
          "JFK conspiracy allegations": "After Roselli's death, journalists Jack Anderson and Les Whitten published an editorial stating that Roselli had told associates that individuals he had been recruited to kill Castro but had been turned by the Cuban leader to assassinate President John F. Kennedy instead.[18]\n\nBill Bonanno, the son of Cosa Nostra boss Joseph Bonanno, claimed in his 1999 memoir, Bound by Honor: A Mafioso's Story, that he had discussed the assassination of Kennedy with Roselli and implicated him as the primary hitman in a conspiracy instigated by the mob.[19][20] According to Bonanno, Roselli fired at Kennedy from a storm drain on Elm Street.[19] In 2006, the Discovery Channel aired an hour-long television documentary entitled Conspiracy Files: JFK.[21] Based on information in the book Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron, the program asserted that Roselli was responsible for framing Abraham Bolden who was arrested the day before he was to appear before the Warren Commission.[21] In 2010, Playboy magazine published an article by Hillel Levin in which Roselli was also implicated in the assassination by Robert \"Tosh\" Plumlee and James Files, an inmate within the Illinois Department of Corrections.[22]",
          "Popular culture": "In the CBS television drama Vegas, the character from the Chicago Mob Johnny Rizzo, portrayed by Michael Wiseman, is loosely based on Johnny Roselli, as when Rizzo is introduced. Rizzo is in the Vegas black book and is not allowed to be in any casino. When Sheriff Ralph Lamb catches Rizzo in one, he demands that Rizzo leave. Rizzo, known for his temper, gets into a fight, and is easily subdued by Lamb. This is based on an actual event involving the real Sheriff Lamb and Roselli.\n\nRoselli was portrayed by Chuck Shamata in the 2007 TNT miniseries The Company, which portrayed Roselli's role in the CIA's unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro. Tony Lo Bianco played Roselli in Oliver Stone's Nixon.\n\nRoselli and gangster Sam Giancana and their involvement with the CIA are the focus of a 2024 Paramount+ docuseries \"Mafia Spies\" based on the book by Thomas Maier.[23]\n\nAssassination attempts on Fidel Castro\nJohn F.

          "Lead": "Jack Leon Ruby (born Jacob Leon Rubenstein; c.[1][2] March 25, 1911 – January 3, 1967) was an American nightclub owner who murdered Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963, two days after Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Ruby operated nightclubs in Texas. On November 24, 1963, two days after President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Ruby shot and mortally wounded Oswald in Dallas Police Headquarters and was immediately arrested. The shooting happened on live television. Ruby was convicted and sentenced to death; this was overturned on appeal, and he was granted a new trial, but Ruby fell ill, was diagnosed with cancer, and died of a pulmonary embolism on January 3, 1967.\n\nIn 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald, that Ruby shot Oswald on impulse and in retaliation for the Kennedy assassination. The Commission's findings are supported by all available evidence and Ruby's own testimony.\n\nHowever, the death of Oswald in police custody so soon after the assassination of Kennedy, sparked unfounded associations between Ruby and the, at the time new, conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination.",
          "Early life and career": "Ruby was born Jacob Leon Rubenstein[4] on or around March 25, 1911,[2] in the Maxwell Street area of Chicago, the son of Joseph Rubenstein and Fannie Turek Rutkowski (or Rokowsky), both Polish-born Orthodox Jews. Ruby was the fifth of his parents' 10 surviving children. While he was growing up, his parents were often violent towards each other and frequently separated; Ruby's mother was eventually committed to a mental hospital.[5]\n\nHis troubled childhood and adolescence were marked by juvenile delinquency with time being spent in foster homes. He was arrested at the age of 11 for truancy. Ruby eventually skipped school so often that he had to spend time at the Institute for Juvenile Research. He sold horse-racing tip sheets and various novelties, then acted as a business agent for a local refuse collectors union that later became part of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT).[6]: 332\n\nFrom his early childhood, Ruby was nicknamed \"Sparky\" by those who knew him.[7] His sister, Eva Grant, said that he acquired the nickname because he resembled a slow-moving horse named \"Spark Plug\" or \"Sparky\" in the contemporary comic strip Barney Google. (\"Spark Plug\" debuted as a character in the strip in 1922.)[7] Other accounts say that the name was given because of his quick temper.[7] Grant stated that Ruby did not like the nickname and was quick to fight anyone who called him that.[7]\n\nIn the 1940s, Ruby frequented race tracks in Illinois and California. He was drafted in 1943 and served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, working as an aircraft mechanic at U.S. bases until 1946. He had an honorable record and was promoted to Private First Class. Upon discharge, in 1946, Ruby returned to Chicago.[5]\n\nIn 1947, Ruby moved to Dallas, purportedly because of the failure of merchandise deals in Chicago and to help operate his sister's nightclub.[7] Soon afterward he and his brothers shortened their surnames from Rubenstein to Ruby. The stated reason for the name change was that the name \"Rubenstein\" was too long and that he was \"well known\" as Jack Ruby.[8] Ruby later went on to manage various nightclubs, strip clubs, and dance halls in Dallas. He developed close ties to many Dallas police officers who frequented his nightclubs, where he provided them with free liquor, prostitutes, and other favors.[9]\n\nRuby never married and had no children.[10] At the time of the assassination, Ruby was living with George Senator, who referred to Ruby as \"my boyfriend\" during the Warren Commission hearing, although he denied the two were homosexual lovers. Warren Commission lawyer Burt Griffin later told author Gerald Posner: \"I'm not sure if Senator was honest with us about his relationship with Ruby. People did not advertise their homosexuality in 1963\".[11]",
          "Illegal activities": "Some critics have said that Ruby was involved in illegal activity[12][6][13] such as gambling, narcotics, and prostitution.[14] An FBI report in 1956 stated that informant Eileen Curry had moved to Dallas with her boyfriend James Breen after jumping bail on narcotics charges. Breen told her that he had made connections with a large narcotics setup operating between Texas, Mexico, and the East, and that \"James got the okay to operate through Ruby of Dallas.\"[15] Dallas County Sheriff Steve Guthrie told the FBI that he believed that Ruby \"operated some prostitution activities and other vices out of his club\" in Dallas.[13] Dallas disc jockey Kenneth Dowe testified that Ruby was known around the station for \"procuring women for different people who came to town\".[16]\n\nFrom 1949, up until the murder of Oswald, Ruby had nine criminal charges, ranging from assault to violating state liquor law.[17]",
          "Character": "According to people interviewed by law enforcement and the Warren Commission, Ruby was desperate to attract attention to himself and his club. He knew a great number of people in Dallas, but had only a few friends. Because his business ventures were unsuccessful, he was heavily in debt.[11]\n\nThe commission received reports of Ruby's penchant for violence. He had a volatile temper, and he often resorted to violence with employees who had upset him. He acted as the bouncer of his own club and beat his customers on at least 25 occasions. The fights would often end with Ruby throwing his victims down the club's stairs.[11] In one fight with a man, the man bit Ruby's left index finger so badly that the doctors had it amputated.[18]\n\nStories of Ruby's eccentric and unstable behavior describe him as sometimes taking his shirt or other clothes off in social gatherings, and either hitting his chest like a gorilla or rolling around on the floor. During conversations, he could change the topic suddenly in mid-sentence. He sometimes welcomed a guest to his club, but on other nights he would forbid the same guest from entering. He was described by those who knew him as \"a kook\", \"totally unpredictable\", \"a psycho\", and \"suffering from some form of disturbance\".[11]\n\nDuring the 1970s, prominent psychiatrist Irene Jakab, who was known for her use of art therapy in diagnosing and treating patients with mental illness, analyzed artwork that had been created by Ruby while he was in jail. While assessing one of Ruby's drawings, which had been included as part of art exhibits at the World Congress of Psychiatry meeting in Waikiki and the University of Hawaii in late August and early September 1977, she claimed that his work conveyed \"repressed aggression and secretiveness,\" adding:[19]\n\nNotice how he really constricts himself so as not to reveal himself. He hides behind all those geometrical lines and pointed edges. You can feel his controlled aggression.",
          "November 21": "The Warren Commission attempted to reconstruct Ruby's movements from November 21, 1963, through November 24.[20]: 333  The Commission reported that he was attending to his duties as the proprietor of the Carousel Club located at 1312 1/2 Commerce St. in downtown Dallas and the Vegas Club in the city's Oak Lawn district from the afternoon of November 21 to the early hours of November 22.[20]: 333  A number of Dallas police officers were meeting in the office of Assistant District Attorney Ben Ellis when Ruby entered and passed out business cards advertising a gig by Jada, a stripper at the Carousel. Reportedly, Ruby introduced himself to Ellis and added: \"You probably don't know me now, but you will.\"[citation needed]",
          "November 22: assassination of Kennedy": "According to the Warren Commission, on November 22, Ruby was in the second-floor advertising offices of the Dallas Morning News, five blocks away from the Texas School Book Depository, placing weekly advertisements for his nightclubs, when he learned of the assassination around 12:45 p.m.[20]: 334–335  According to witnesses, Ruby was visibly shaken. Ruby then made phone calls to his assistant at the Carousel Club and to his sister.[20]: 334  The Commission stated that an employee of the Dallas Morning News estimated that Ruby left the newspaper's offices at 1:30 p.m., but indicated that other testimony suggested that he had left earlier.[20]: 334–335  According to the Warren Commission, Ruby arrived back at the Carousel Club shortly before 1:45 p.m. to notify employees that the club would be closed that evening.[20]: 336–337\n\nJohn Newnam, an employee at the newspaper's advertisement department, testified that Ruby became upset over an anti-Kennedy ad published in the Morning News that was signed by \"The American Fact-Finding Committee, Bernard Weissman, Chairman.\" Ruby was sensitive to antisemitism and was distressed that an ad attacking the President was signed by a person with a \"Jewish name.\" Early the next morning, Ruby noticed a political billboard featuring the text \"IMPEACH EARL WARREN\" in block letters. Ruby's sister Eva testified that Ruby had told her that he believed that the anti-Kennedy ad and the anti-Warren sign were connected and were a plot by a \"gentile\" to blame the assassination on the Jews.[11]\n\nRuby was seen in the halls of the Dallas Police Headquarters on several occasions after Oswald's arrest for the murder of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit. He was present at an arranged press conference with Oswald. Ruby later told the FBI that he had his .38 Colt Cobra revolver in his right pocket during the press conference.[21][22][6]: 3501  Newsreel footage from WFAA-TV (Dallas) and NBC shows that Ruby impersonated a newspaper reporter during a press conference held by District Attorney Henry Wade at Dallas Police Headquarters that night.[6]: 349  Wade briefed reporters that Oswald was a member of the anti-Castro Free Cuba Committee. Ruby was one of several people there who spoke up to correct Wade, saying, \"Henry, that's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee\", a pro-Castro organization.[23][24][6]: 349–350",
          "November 24: murder of Oswald": "On November 24, at 11:21 a.m. CST, Oswald was being escorted by Dallas police Detectives Jim Leavelle and L. C. Graves through the police basement to an armored car that was to take Oswald to the nearby county jail, when Ruby who was standing in a crowd of reporters, emerged with his revolver[25] aimed at Oswald's abdomen. Ruby passed by William Harrison who saw the gun and began to reach his hand out.[26] Detective Billy Combest described Ruby's facial expression as that of a \"determined look or grimace\".[27] Ruby shot Oswald at point blank range, mortally wounding him.[28][29][30] Combest exclaimed, \"Jack, you son of a bitch!\"[31][32]\n\nImmediately after the shot was fired, Graves grabbed for Ruby's gun, and Harrison grabbed Ruby's shoulder, as the armored car had rolled down the ramp at the moment Ruby emerged and slightly hit Ruby's leg almost immediately after he fired, causing him to almost lose balance as he was immediately subdued by police. Ruby and Oswald were both taken into the basement level jail office. After Ruby was handcuffed and taken up in the elevator, Oswald was placed in an ambulance and driven to Parkland Memorial Hospital, the same hospital where President Kennedy had died two days earlier.[33]: 184–185 [34]\n\nAt Parkland, surgeons subsequently determined Ruby's bullet had entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused extensive damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.[35] Oswald died at 1:07 pm.[4]\n\nA network television pool camera was broadcasting live to cover Oswald's transfer; millions of people watching on NBC saw the shooting as it happened and in a matter of minutes it was on other networks.[36] Several photographs were taken of the event, capturing the moments when Ruby pulled the trigger. In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the Dallas Times Herald was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his image, titled Jack Ruby Shoots Lee Harvey Oswald.[37]\n\nGreat indignation was directed towards Ruby's murder of Oswald. Many felt that the killing had robbed the nation of essential information and left key questions unanswered. Former Vice President Richard Nixon said, \"(Oswald was) also entitled to a trial ... two wrongs don't make a right.\"[38] Oswald's murder compounded suspicions that the Kennedy assassination was part of a larger plot.[39]\n\nNot all were shocked, however. The crowd outside the headquarters applauded when they heard that Oswald had been shot.[40] In Dallas and elsewhere in the nation, Oswald was hated in death, and Ruby was viewed as a hero by some citizens. During his time in jail, he received many letters from the public, often praising him for his actions.",
          "Prosecution": "After his arrest, Ruby said that he had been distraught over President Kennedy's death, had wanted to help the city of Dallas \"redeem\" itself in the eyes of the public, and that he was \"saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial.\"[41]: 198–200  He also claimed that he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so.[41]: 199  Ruby said that he was an admirer of President Kennedy and the Kennedy family, that he cried when he heard that the President was shot, \"in mourning\" after, \"cried a great deal\" Saturday afternoon, and was depressed that night.[citation needed] The grief over the assassination, Ruby stated, finally \"reached the point of insanity,\" suddenly compelling him to shoot when Oswald walked in front of him in the basement that Sunday morning.[42]\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Ruby said that he was taking phenmetrazine (Preludin), a central nervous system stimulant.[41]: 198–199  Ruby also said that he entered the police basement by coming down the Main Street ramp. Later, Ruby expressed remorse to his brother Earl, saying he never wanted Oswald to die.[43] Ruby asked Dallas attorney Tom Howard to represent him. Howard accepted and asked Ruby if he could think of anything that might damage his defense. Ruby responded that there would be a problem if a man by the name of \"Davis\" should come up. Ruby told his attorney that he \"had been involved with Davis, who was a gunrunner entangled in anti-Castro efforts.\"[44][45]\n\nRuby's brother Earl replaced Howard with prominent San Francisco defense attorney Melvin Belli, who agreed to represent him pro bono. Lawyer Joe H. Tonahill also signed on to assist with Ruby's defense. At his bond hearing in January 1964, while talking to reporters, Ruby tearfully said, regarding the assassination of Kennedy, that he could not understand \"how a great man like that could be lost.\"[46]\n\nRuby testified that he thought he said, \"You killed my President, you rat!\" as he shot Oswald. Officer McMillon testified he heard Ruby say, \"You rat son of a bitch, you shot the president\". This was disputed by footage showing McMillon looking in the opposite direction from the shooting.[47] Dallas police sergeant Patrick Dean testified that when Ruby was arrested, Ruby said he thought about killing Oswald two nights earlier, to show the world that \"Jews have guts.\"[48] Detective Don Archer said Ruby had told him he intended to shoot Oswald three times, and McMillon corroborated this.[49]\n\nOn March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of murder with malice and was sentenced to death. Ruby's conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the grounds that \"an oral confession of premeditation made while in police custody\" should have been ruled inadmissible, because it violated a Texas criminal statute.[50] The court also ruled that the venue should have been changed to a Texas county other than the one in which the high-profile crime had been committed.[50]\n\nDuring the six months following the Kennedy assassination, Ruby repeatedly asked to speak to the members of the Warren Commission. The commission initially showed no interest, but Ruby's sister Eileen wrote letters to the commission and her letters became public. The Commission finally agreed to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren, Representative (and future President) Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, and other commission members went to Dallas to see Ruby.[citation needed]\n\nRuby asked Warren several times to take him to Washington D.C., saying that \"my life is in danger here\" and that he wanted an opportunity to make additional statements. He added that the people from whom he felt himself to be in danger were the John Birch Society of Dallas, including Edwin Walker, who he claimed were trying to falsely implicate him as being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the President.[41]: 194–196  He added: \"I want to tell the truth, and I can't tell it here.\"[41]: 194  Warren told Ruby that he would be unable to comply with his request because many legal barriers would need to be overcome, and public interest in the situation would be too heavy. Warren also told Ruby that the commission would have no way of protecting him since it had no police powers. Ruby said that he wanted to convince President Lyndon Johnson that he was not part of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy.[41]: 209–212\n\nEventually, the appellate court agreed with Ruby's lawyers that he should be granted a new trial. On October 5, 1966, the court ruled that his motion for a change of venue before the original trial court should have been granted. Ruby's conviction and death sentence were overturned.\n\nArrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967[51] in Wichita Falls, Texas, but Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital on December 9, 1966, suffering from pneumonia, where he was diagnosed with cancer in his liver, lungs, and brain.[citation needed] His condition rapidly deteriorated. An armed guard was placed outside his room, but family and friends were allowed to visit. On December 16, Earl Ruby, accompanied by one of his brother's lawyers, smuggled a tape recorder hidden in a briefcase into Jack's room to record an interview about his murder of Oswald. Ruby maintained that he entered the basement by coming down the ramp, had killed Oswald out of grief over the assassination, and denied knowing Oswald prior.[52] According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19 that he had acted alone.[53] \"There is nothing to hide,\" Ruby said, \"there was no one else.\"[54]",
          "Death": "Ruby died of a pulmonary embolism on January 3, 1967, at Parkland Hospital.[55] He was buried beside his parents in the Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois.[56][57][58]",
          "Warren Commission": "The Warren Commission found no evidence linking Ruby's killing of Oswald with any broader conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.[20] The report provided a detailed biography of Ruby's life and activities to help ascertain whether he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy.[59] The Commission also investigated rumors that Ruby and Oswald knew each other or that Oswald was seen at the Carousel Club. Footage that showed Oswald glance briefly in Ruby's direction as he emerged to shoot him, thought by some to be a look of recognition, compounded such suspicion. Careful analysis of the footage indicate Oswald was looking at reporter Ike Pappas who had held his microphone out towards Oswald and asked, \"Do you have anything to say in your defense?\"[60] They concluded that various witnesses lacked credibility and that there was no solid evidence linking the two men.[61][62] The Commission indicated that there was not a \"significant link between Ruby and organized crime\"[63] and said he acted independently in killing Oswald.[64][20]: 373–374\n\nThe Warren Commission noted testimony indicating Ruby entered the basement of the headquarters just as Oswald was being transferred and that his shooting of Oswald was a spontaneous, unplanned act. Ruby drove into town with his pet dachshund Sheba to send an emergency money order at the Western Union on Main Street to one of his employees. The time stamp was 11:17 a.m. for the transaction. Ruby then walked half a block to the Dallas police headquarters, where he made his way into the basement. Warren Commission investigator David Belin said that postal inspector Harry Holmes arrived unannounced at the Dallas police station on the morning that Ruby shot Oswald and, upon invitation by the investigators, had questioned Oswald, thus delaying his transfer by half an hour.[65] Belin noted that, had Ruby been part of a conspiracy, he would have been downtown 30 minutes earlier, when Oswald had been scheduled to be transferred.[65] The commission accepted Ruby's claim that he entered the police basement via the Main Street ramp.[66] Author Norman Mailer and others have questioned why Ruby would have left his beloved dog in his car if his killing of Oswald had been planned.[67]\n\nSome of Ruby's friends, relatives (notably his brother Earl and sister Eva) and associates, supported the official conclusion that Ruby acted alone, maintaining that he was upset over President Kennedy's death, even crying on occasions and closing his clubs for three days as a mark of respect.[68][69][70][71] They rejected conspiracy theorists' claims, saying that Ruby's connection with gangsters was minimal at most and that he was not the sort of person who would be entrusted to be part of a conspiracy.[70][72]\n\nDallas reporter Tony Zoppi, who knew Ruby well, claimed that one \"would have to be crazy\" to entrust Ruby with anything as important as a high-level plot to kill Kennedy since he \"couldn't keep a secret for five minutes ... Jack was one of the most talkative guys you would ever meet. He'd be the worst fellow in the world to be part of a conspiracy, because he just plain talked too much.\"[70]: 361, 399  He and others described Ruby as the sort who enjoyed being at \"the center of attention\", trying to make friends with people and being more of a nuisance.[70]\n\nSome writers, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, dismiss Ruby's connections to organized crime as being highly minimal: \"It is very noteworthy that without exception, not one of these conspiracy theorists knew or had ever met Jack Ruby. Without our even resorting to his family and roommate, all of whom think the suggestion of Ruby being connected to the mob is ridiculous, those who knew him, unanimously and without exception, think the notion of his being connected to the Mafia, and then killing Oswald for them, is nothing short of laughable.\"[73]\n\nBill Alexander, who prosecuted Ruby for Oswald's murder, equally rejected any suggestions that Ruby was involved with organized crime, claiming that conspiracy theorists based it on the claim that \"A knew B, and Ruby knew B back in 1950, so he must have known A, and that must be the link to the conspiracy.\"[70]\n\nRuby's brother Earl denied allegations that Jack was involved in racketeering at Chicago nightclubs, and author Gerald Posner suggested in his book Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK, that witnesses may have confused Ruby with Harry Rubenstein, a convicted Chicago felon.[70] Zoppi was also dismissive of mob ties and described Ruby as a \"born loser\".[70]",
          "Outside investigations and conspiracy theories": "Since 1963, many conspiracists have ignored the evidence or conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, particularly regarding Ruby's role in Oswald’s death.",
          "Ruby's motive": "White House correspondent Seth Kantor, who was a passenger in Kennedy's motorcade, testified that he had visited Parkland Hospital after Kennedy was shot, and that he felt a tug on his coat as he entered the hospital at about 1:30 p.m. He turned around to see Jack Ruby, who called him by his first name and shook his hand.[74]: 78–82 [44]: 41  He said that he had become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper.[74]: 72 [44]: vi  According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy, and Kantor responded without thinking that doing so would be a good idea.[44]: 41 [75][74]: 80\n\nAlthough Wilma Tice testified that she saw Ruby at Parkland Hospital, claiming to have later recognized his picture and that she saw a man, who possibly may have been Kantor, call him \"Jack\",[76] Ruby denied that he had been at Parkland Hospital and the Warren Commission dismissed Kantor's testimony, saying that the encounter at Parkland Hospital would have to have taken place in a span of a few minutes before and after 1:30 pm, as evidenced by telephone company records of calls made by both people. The commission also pointed to contradictory witness testimony and to the lack of video confirmation of Ruby at the scene.[20]: 335–337  The Commission concluded that \"Kantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital\" and \"may have been mistaken about both the time and the place that he saw Ruby.\"[20]: 335–337\n\nIn 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations re-examined Kantor's testimony and stated, \"the Warren Commission concluded that Kantor was mistaken\" about his Parkland encounter with Ruby, but \"the Committee determined he probably was not.\"[77]: 158 [6]: 458–459  Kantor wrote in Who Was Jack Ruby?:\n\nThe mob was Ruby's \"friend.\" And Ruby could well have been paying off an IOU the day he was used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. Remember: \"I have been used for a purpose,\" the way Ruby expressed it to Chief Justice Warren in their June 7, 1964 session. It would not have been hard for the mob to maneuver Ruby through the ranks of a few negotiable police.[44]: 18\n\nThe House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote in its 1979 Final Report:\n\nRuby's shooting of Oswald was not a spontaneous act, in that it involved at least some premeditation. Similarly, the committee believed it was less likely that Ruby entered the police basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have been provided with no knowledge of Ruby's intentions.... The committee was troubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and the removal of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairway shortly before the shooting.... There is also evidence that the Dallas Police Department withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerning Ruby's entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer.[77]: 157–158\n\nThe HSCA suggested Ruby might have entered the basement via a stairway accessible from an alleyway next to the Dallas Municipal Building.[78]\n\nGarrett C. Hallmark, manager of the parking garage, said that Ruby talked on the phone at 3 p.m. on November 23 to somebody called Ken. He was seeking confirmation of the scheduled time for Oswald's transfer and he said \"You know I'll be there.\"[79] Later that evening, waitress Wanda Helmick at Bull-Pen Drive-In Restaurant in Arlington, Texas, which was operated by Ralph Paul, a close friend and business associate of Ruby, said that Ruby rang Paul and that she overheard that Paul said something about a gun, and he asked Ruby if he were crazy.[80]\n\nLieutenant Billy Grammer, a dispatcher for the Dallas Police Department, claimed that he received an anonymous phone call at 3 a.m. on November 24 from a man who told him that he knew of the plan to move Oswald from the basement and warned that, unless the plan were changed, \"we are going to kill him.\" After Oswald was shot, Grammer claimed to have recognized Ruby as the caller, and expressed belief that Ruby's shooting of Oswald was \"a planned event.\"[81][82] In a declassified FBI memo written by J. Edgar Hoover from the day of Oswald's shooting, he reported that the night before Oswald's death, the FBI in Dallas received a call from \"a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald\". The FBI called the chief of Dallas police both at that time and the morning after to ensure Oswald would be kept safe. Hoover adds that \"however, this was not done\".[83]\n\nSome critics point to eyewitness testimony which seem to contradict the official claim that Ruby was at home until 10:30 a.m. on November 24 and instead seem to indicate that Ruby was around the police Headquarters asking about Oswald's transfer all morning. Ruby's roommate George Senator testified that on November 24, Ruby was in his apartment until about 10:30 a.m.. However, Elnora Pitts, Ruby's cleaning lady, phoned between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. to check it was alright for her to do her usual Sunday morning cleaning for Ruby (which she had been doing for several weeks). The man who answered claimed to be Ruby but did not sound like him, did not recognise Pitts and had no knowledge of the Sunday cleaning arrangements she had with Ruby.[84] Johnnie Smith, of WBAP-TV, was in a TV truck outside the headquarters that morning and he said that he saw a man twice between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.; the man came to the truck to enquire about Oswald's transfer. Smith said that he recognized the man as Ruby from a picture in the paper, though he said he could not recognize him from a mugshot.[85] WBAP cameraman Ira Walker testified that a man came up to his TV truck at just after 10:30 a.m. and enquired about Oswald's transfer. He identified the man as Ruby as did Warren Richey who was on top of the truck with his camera.[86]\n\nIn his Warren Commission testimony, Detective Don Archer claimed that, after his arrest, Ruby looked him straight in the eye and said, \"Well, I intended to shoot him three times.\" Kantor wrote that Ruby's response to Archer did not suggest a spontaneous reaction, and that he implied having prior intention.[44]: 192  On another occasion Archer also said that Ruby was agitated and sweating but when Archer informed Ruby that Oswald had died \"he became calm\" and that this struck him as \"a complete difference in behaviour from what I expected\", leading him to believe that \"his life had depended on his getting Oswald\".[87]\n\nRuby's explanation for killing Oswald would be exposed \"as a fabricated legal ploy\", according to the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Ruby wrote a note to attorney Joseph Tonahill: \"Joe, you should know this. My first lawyer Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?\"[77]: 158 [88][6]: 353 [42]\n\nG. Robert Blakey, who was chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: \"The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever.\"[89]\n\nRussell Moore, an acquaintance of Ruby, testified to the Commission that Ruby expressed no bitterness towards Oswald and called him \"a good looking guy,\" comparing him to the actor Paul Newman.[90][91] Announcer Glen Duncan also said Ruby described Oswald as a \"fairly nice looking kid\" comparing him to Newman.[92]\n\nAuthor David Scheim writes that while some described Ruby as upset over the weekend of the assassination, others said that he was not. TV newsman Vic Robertson Jr. saw Ruby at police headquarters on Friday night and said that he \"appeared to be anything but under stress or strain. He seemed happy, jovial, was joking and laughing.\"[93][42] Duncan also said that Ruby \"was not grieving\" and seemed \"happy that evidence was piling up against Oswald.\"[42]\n\nScheim also suggests that Ruby made a \"candid confession\" when giving testimony to the Warren Commission.[42] During his testimony, Ruby teared up when talking about a Saturday morning eulogy for Kennedy, but after composing himself, inexplicably said, \"I must be a great actor, I tell you that.\"[41]: 198–199 [42] Ruby also remarked that \"they didn't ask me another question: 'If I loved the President so much, why wasn't I at the parade?'\" (referring to the presidential motorcade) and \"it's strange that perhaps I didn't vote for President Kennedy, or didn't vote at all, that I should build up such a great affection for him.\"[94]: 564–565 [42] Ruby's club stripper Jada, during an interview with ABC's Paul Good, said that \"I believe [Ruby] disliked Bobby Kennedy\".[42]\n\nSchiem also noted some who knew Ruby who stated that the patriotic statements which Ruby professed were quite out of character. Ruby's gambling business partner Harry Hall said \"Ruby was the type who was interested in any way to make money,\" and he also said that he \"could not conceive of Ruby doing anything out of patriotism.\"[95][42] Jack Kelly had known Ruby since 1943, and he \"scoffed at the idea of a patriotic motive...\" and felt that Ruby would have killed Oswald \"for publicity [or] for money\".[42] Ruby's friend Paul Jones also said that he doubted that Ruby \"would have become emotionally upset and killed Oswald on the spur of the moment. He felt Ruby would have done it for money.\"[42]\n\nRuby's lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals after his 1964 conviction, the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby's lawyers argued that he could not have received a fair trial in Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. In an interview with reporters in March 1965, Ruby stated: \"Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motive. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world.\" A reporter asked, \"Are these people in very high positions, Jack?\", and he responded, \"Yes.\"[96]\n\nKantor speculated in 1978 that the \"Davis\" that Ruby mentioned to Tom Howard may have been Thomas Eli Davis III, a CIA-connected mercenary.[6]: 226, 359–361 [97]\n\nDallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: \"Ruby told me, he said, 'Well, they injected me for a cold.' He said it was cancer cells. That's what he told me, Ruby did. I said you don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' One day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel a piece of paper in his palm.\" It was a note in which Ruby claimed that he was part of a conspiracy, and that his role was to silence Oswald.[98] Not long before Ruby died, according to an article in the London Sunday Times, he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was \"an act of overthrowing the government\" and that he knew \"who had President Kennedy killed\". He added: \"I am doomed. I do not want to die. But I am not insane. I was framed to kill Oswald.\"[98][99][6]: 341\n\nOn March 11, 1959, FBI agent Charles W. Flynn of the Dallas Office approached Ruby to become a federal informant due to his job as a night club operator, since he \"might have knowledge of the criminal element in Dallas\".[100] Ruby was willing to become an informant and was contacted by the FBI eight times between March 11, 1959, and October 2, 1959, but he provided no information to the Bureau; he was not paid, and contact ceased.[101][102][further explanation needed][a]\n\nScheim theorised that Mafia leaders Carlos Marcello and Santo Trafficante Jr. and organized labor leader Jimmy Hoffa ordered the assassination of Kennedy. Scheim cited in particular a 25-fold increase in the number of out-of-state telephone calls from Jack Ruby to associates of these crime bosses in the months before the assassination.[105] According to author Vincent Bugliosi, both the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations determined that all of these calls were related to Ruby seeking help from the American Guild of Variety Artists in a matter concerning two of his competitors.[106] The House Select Committee on Assassinations report stated that \"most of Ruby's phone calls during late 1963 were related to his labor troubles. In the light of the identity of some of the individuals with whom Ruby spoke, however, the possibility of other matters being discussed could not be dismissed.\"[107]\n\nBill Bonanno, son of New York Mafia boss Joseph Bonanno, stated in Bound By Honor that he realized that certain Mafia families were involved in the JFK assassination when Ruby killed Oswald, since Bonanno was aware that Ruby was an associate of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.[108]",
          "Associations with organized crime and gunrunning allegations": "Some conspiracy theorists have suggested Ruby had links to organized crime.[109][110] The House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook a similar investigation of Ruby in 1979, 15 years after the written report, and said that he \"had a significant number of associations and direct and indirect contacts with underworld figures\" and \"the Dallas criminal element,\" but that he was not a member of organized crime.[111] In a memo dated to the day of Oswald's murder J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, wrote that \"We have no information on Ruby that is firm, although there are some rumors of underworld activity in Chicago\".[112]\n\nRuby was said to have been acquainted with the Mafia. The HSCA said that Ruby had known Chicago mobster Sam Giancana and Joseph Campisi since 1947 and had been seen with them on many occasions.[113][6]: 346  After an investigation of Joe Campisi, the HSCA found:\n\nWhile Campisi's technical characterization in federal law enforcement records as an organized crime member has ranged from definite to suspected to negative, it is clear that he was an associate or friend of many Dallas-based organized crime members, particularly Joseph Civello, during the time he was the head of the Dallas organization. There was no indication that Campisi had engaged in any specific organized crime-related activities.[114]\n\nG. Robert Blakey, the chief counsel for the HSCA, called Campisi \"the No. 2 man in the mob in Dallas.\" He wrote in a 1993 article for The Washington Post: \"It is difficult to dispute the underworld pedigree of Jack Ruby, though the Warren Commission did it in 1964.[115] Similarly, a PBS Frontline investigation into the connections between Ruby and Dallas organized crime figures reported the following:\n\nIn 1963, Sam and Joe Campisi were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. Jack knew the Campisis and had been seen with them on many occasions. The Campisis were lieutenants of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss who had reportedly talked of killing the President.[116]\n\nOn the night before Kennedy was assassinated, Ruby and Ralph Paul had dinner together at the Egyptian Lounge run by Joe and Sam Campisi.[117] After Ruby was jailed for killing Oswald, Joe Campisi \"regularly visited\" him.[117]\n\nHoward P. Willens was the third-highest official in the Department of Justice[118] and assistant counsel to J. Lee Rankin. He helped organize the Warren Commission. Willens also outlined the commission's investigative priorities[119] and terminated an investigation of Ruby's Cuban related activities.[120] An FBI report states that Willens' father had been Tony Accardo's next-door neighbor going back to 1958.[121] In 1946, Tony Accardo allegedly asked Jack Ruby to go to Texas with Mafia associates Pat Manno and Romie Nappi to make sure that Dallas County Sheriff Steve Gutherie would acquiesce to the Mafia's expansion into Dallas.[122]\n\nRuby went to see a man named Lewis McWillie in Cuba four years before the assassination. McWillie had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, and Ruby considered him one of his closest friends.[41]: 201  McWillie was supervising gambling activities at Havana's Tropicana Club when Ruby visited him in August 1959. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie.[41]: 201  The HSCA later concluded that Ruby \"most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests\".[77]: 152 [123][6]: 337  The committee also found circumstantial but not conclusive evidence that \"Ruby met with Santo Trafficante Jr. in Cuba sometime in 1959.\"[77]: 152–153 [6]: 338\n\nJames E. Beaird, who claimed to be a poker-playing friend of Ruby, told The Dallas Morning News and the FBI that Ruby smuggled guns and ammunition from Galveston Bay, Texas to Fidel Castro's guerrillas in Cuba in the late 1950s. Beaird said that Ruby \"was in it for the money. It wouldn't matter which side, just the one that would pay him the most.\" Beaird said that the guns were stored in a two-story house near the waterfront, and that he saw Ruby and his associates load \"many boxes of new guns, including automatic rifles and handguns\" on a 50-foot military-surplus boat. He claimed that \"each time that the boat left with guns and ammunition, Jack Ruby was on the boat.\"[124][125][6]: 335\n\nAlternatively, some conspiracy theorists have focused on Ruby's connections to the police in regards to his murder of Oswald, and dismiss his mob connections as a misdirection.[126]\n\n^ In a 1977 document, it was claimed that Bob Vanderslice, a Dallas Police informant, said Ruby had told him to \"watch the fireworks\" on November 22 and that both witnessed Kennedy being shot.[103] Posner disputes this story.[104]\n\n^ In a 1977 document, it was claimed that Bob Vanderslice, a Dallas Police informant, said Ruby had told him to \"watch the fireworks\" on November 22 and that both witnessed Kennedy being shot.[103] Posner disputes this story.[104]\n\n^\na b Birth records were not officially kept in Chicago prior to 1915, and among school records, driver's licenses, and arrest records, there were six different dates, ranging from March to June 1911.\n^\na b c The Warren Commission found that various dates were given in the records for Ruby's birth; the one most used by Ruby himself was March 25, 1911. His grave marker has April 25, 1911, as his birthdate.\n^ \"Jack Ruby sentenced to death for murdering Lee Harvey Oswald\". Archived from the original on December 23, 2021.

          "Lead": "Perry Raymond Russo (May 14, 1941 – August 16, 1995)[1][2] was an American insurance salesman who became the key witness for the prosecution in the trial of Clay Shaw in New Orleans in 1969. Russo claimed that in September 1963, he witnessed businessman and civic leader Clay Shaw conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie to assassinate U.S. President John F. Kennedy.",
          "Friend of David Ferrie": "Russo was an insurance salesman from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He attended Tulane University, received a bachelor's degree from Loyola University New Orleans in 1964, and attended one year of law school at Loyola.[2][3] He moved away from New Orleans in September 1965.[3] Russo came forward after his friend David Ferrie died on February 22, 1967, while being investigated by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison in regard to Kennedy's death. In four television and newspaper interviews that Russo gave,[4] he talked at length about Ferrie. He said that Ferrie had told him about a month before the assassination: \"We will get him, and it won't be long,\" and on another occasion, \"You know we can get Kennedy if we want him.\"\n\nRusso said nothing in the interviews about Oswald, Shaw, or a conspiracy.[5] When a television reporter asked him on February 24 if Ferrie had ever mentioned Oswald's name, Russo said, \"No. I had never heard of Oswald until the television [coverage] of the assassination.\"[6]\n\nHowever, when he was interviewed by Garrison's office on February 27, Russo described a roommate of Ferrie's in New Orleans as having \"sort of dirty blond hair and a husky beard … a typical beatnik, extremely dirty.\" When Russo was shown a picture of Oswald, he said that Oswald was the person whom Ferrie had introduced to him as his roommate sometime between May and October 1963.[7] When shown a picture of Shaw, Russo said he saw him and Ferrie talking in a car at Ferrie's service station. But still Russo said nothing about Shaw or Oswald conspiring with Ferrie to murder Kennedy.[8] Russo added that if he were hypnotized he may have total recall on names and places and dates.\n\nGarrison arranged to have Russo interrogated three times while hypnotized, the first time while also under an injection of sodium thiopental, known popularly as \"truth serum\". Now Russo described a conspiracy plot, with Shaw (using the alias \"Bertrand\") and a rifle-toting \"Leon\" Oswald at Ferrie's apartment when Russo was visiting in mid-September 1963. Russo said Ferrie told him, \"We are going to kill John F. Kennedy\" and \"it won't be long.\"[9]",
          "Testimony against Clay Shaw": "At Shaw's preliminary hearing on March 15, 1967, Russo repeated the claims he had made under hypnosis. When asked on cross-examination why he had not gone to the authorities two months after the alleged meeting, when Kennedy was assassinated, Russo replied, \"I had an involvement with school, which was more pressing to me.\"[3]\n\nRusso named two witnesses who could corroborate his story of attending a party at Ferrie's apartment in September 1963 in which the assassination plot was made. The first, Russo's former girlfriend, appeared on an NBC News program about the Garrison investigation on June 19, 1967, and denied being at Ferrie's apartment, and said that she never even met Ferrie until 1965. The second, a friend of Russo's, told NBC News that he was at Ferrie's apartment then but saw nobody resembling Oswald or Shaw.[10]\n\nRusso failed two polygraph examinations ordered by Garrison, on March 8 and June 19, and during the second he confessed to the polygraph operator that his story was not true.[11][12] Walter Sheridan, a former FBI agent and aide to Robert F. Kennedy who was investigating the Garrison accusations for NBC News, reported,\n\nAt a press conference with Garrison the day after the NBC broadcast, Russo accused Sheridan of attempting to bribe him into changing his story, and of alternating between promises and threats in seeking his help to \"wreck the Garrison investigation.\" NBC News denied the allegations, and Sheridan said that Russo had solicited offers from them. George Lardner of The Washington Post who reported on the story said a week or two earlier that Russo solicited a bribe from him in order to divulge \"weaknesses\" in his testimony.[13][14]\n\nGarrison had Russo testify two years later at the Clay Shaw trial, which ended in a not-guilty verdict after less than an hour of jury deliberation.",
          "Later life": "In August 1970, Perry Russo and another man were arrested for burglarizing a New Orleans residence, stealing property valued at eight thousand dollars, and being in possession of a stolen safe-deposit key. Garrison’s office declined to prosecute on the burglary and theft charges. Russo pled guilty to possessing the stolen key and was given a three-month suspended sentence.[15][16][17]\n\nIn 1971, two years after Shaw's not-guilty verdict, Russo told one of Shaw's lawyers that he never saw Shaw at Ferrie's apartment, and that Garrison's office had done \"a complete brainwashing job\" on him.[18][19] In a second, tape-recorded interview with a former Garrison investigator and two of Shaw's attorneys, Russo spoke of Garrison and his staff telling him before the trial that they had a contract with Life magazine for $25,000, and that \"after the Shaw conviction\" they would \"either give that to me or see somehow that I got a lot of it for my trouble.\" Russo also said, \"I guess I always knew [Shaw] had nothing to do with anything.\"[20] But to others, Russo continued to assert that he had seen Ferrie, Shaw, and Oswald conspiring to kill President Kennedy.[21]\n\nJournalist James Phelan, who covered the Garrison investigation for The Saturday Evening Post, later explained,\n\nOliver Stone's 1991 film JFK has Russo's testimony given by a character named \"Willie O'Keefe\". Stone has said that in addition to Perry Russo, O’Keefe was a composite of three other Garrison witnesses — David Logan, Raymond Broshears, and William Morris.[23] In addition, Russo made a cameo appearance as an angry bar patron in the scene where news of the President's death is received.[24] George Lardner of The Washington Post, noting that in June 1967 Russo had invited him to \"bribe him to disclose 'weaknesses' in his testimony\", wrote that it was a \"convenient device\" for Stone to have eliminated Russo from his script.[14]\n\nOffering a counter view to Stone's JFK, author and New Orleans native Nicholas Lemann wrote an opinion piece in the January 1992 issue of GQ criticizing Garrison's prosecution of Shaw and expressing the view that it had embarrassed the city of New Orleans. Lemann's only reference to Russo described him as \"a young insurance salesman-cum-grifter who claimed to have overheard Shaw and Ferrie discussing the assassination at a party.\" In November 1992 Russo sued the publisher, Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. d/b/a Conde Nast Publications, for defamation. Noting that \"Lemann intended to communicate both the longstanding controversy over Russo's testimony against Shaw, and Russo's admittedly strange existence on the fringes of respectable society\", District judge Charles Schwartz Jr. dismissed Russo's claims against the publisher.[25]\n\nRusso, who had been working as a driver for United Cab in New Orleans, died of a heart attack at age 54.[26][27]\n\n^ Social Security Death Index.\n^\na b Transcript of Russo’s testimony at Clay Shaw's trial on February 10, 1969, HSCA Record 180-10097-10190, p. 10.\n^\na b c Transcript of Russo's testimony at the preliminary hearing for the Clay Shaw trial, March 1967.\n^ Dave Reitzes, Perry Raymond Russo: Way Too Willing Witness.\n^ Perry Russo interviews.\n^ Transcript of Jim Kemp’s interview of Perry Russo on p. 213 of transcript of Russo’s testimony at Clay Shaw's trial on February 10, 1969, HSCA Record 180-10097-10190.\n^ After moving by himself to New Orleans in late April 1963, Lee Oswald lived at the home of his aunt, Lillian Murret, until he got his own apartment on May 10.

          "The Assassination of President John Kennedy": "Ryder worked at the Irving, Texas Sports Shop and stated that he possessed a record of Lee Harvey Oswald's name. The Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of John F. Kennedy, looked into a report that Oswald had a telescopic sight mounted and sighted at the store in which Ryder was employed. Ryder showed agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on November 25, 1963, a tag which he claimed was in Oswald's handwriting.[1] The undated tag, with the name OSWALD,[2] attested that three holes had been drilled into an unspecified kind of rifle. Further, a telescopic sight had been mounted on the rifle and boresighted.[3] The customer paid $4.50 for drilling and $1.50 for boresighting the rifle.[4]\n\nNeither Dial or his employer, Charles W. Greener, believed that they had worked on the gun.[1] Dial told author Leo Sauvage the rifle Oswald ordered from Chicago, Illinois came equipped with a telescopic sight. He elaborated, saying that the rifle with the undated tag must have been another weapon than the one Oswald received by mail,[3] in March 1963.[4] Dial stated either it was another rifle or another Oswald.[3]\n\nRyder believed that a close inspection of the 6.5 mm Mannlicher Carcano owned by Oswald would reveal that neither he or his shop worked on the gun.[5]",
          "Personal life": "Ryder was born in Claremont, Illinois.[6] In 1945, Ryder moved with his family to Irving, Texas and graduated from Irving High School. He served in the Texas National Guard and the United States Army.[7]\n\n^\na b President John F.

          "Lead": "Lucien Sarti (8 October 1937[1] – 28 April 1972[2]) was a French drug trafficker.[3] Sarti was shot to death in Mexico in 1972 in a drug trafficking ring raid.",
          "Drug smuggling": "On 19 April 1968, Sarti was arrested along with Auguste Ricord and François Chiappe for questioning regarding the robbery of a branch of the National Bank of Argentina.[4] The three were released due to lack of evidence.[4] In April 1972, Sarti was shot to death in Mexico City during a raid of a drug trafficking ring by the Mexican federal police.[3][4][5] A detective in Rio de Janeiro was later suspended from the police force after being accused of accepting a bribe to free Sarti and Helena Ferreira, his girlfriend, from jail earlier in 1972.[6] In January 1975, four French citizens alleged to have supplied heroin to Sarti were among a group of 19 indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn.[5]",
          "The Murderers of John F. Kennedy and The Men Who Killed Kennedy": "In November 1988, Steve J. Rivele's French-published book The Murderers of John F. Kennedy named Sarti as one of three French gangsters involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[7] Rivele claimed Sarti fired the fatal shot from Dealey Plaza's \"grassy knoll\".[7] According to Rivele, Sarti, Roger Bocagnani, and Sauveur Pironti were contracted by organized crime in the United States to protect their drug interests.[7][8] The British two-hour television special The Men Who Killed Kennedy was based on Rivele's book, but preceded its release airing on October 25, 1988.[7][8] In the French newspaper Le Provençal published the day following the special, Pironti denied the allegation, stating that he believed at the time of the assassination that Sarti was held in Marseille's Baumettes Prison and that Bocagnani was in Bordeaux's Fort du Hâ.[8] He also showed the paper military records proving that he was serving on a minesweeper from October 1962 to April 1964.[8] The French Ministry of Justice stated that Bocagnani was in prison on the day of Kennedy's assassination and officials from the French Navy confirmed Pironti's military service.[8]",
          "E. Howard Hunt": "After the death of E. Howard Hunt in 2007, Howard St. John Hunt and David Hunt stated that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.[9][10] In the April 5th, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Howard St. John Hunt detailed a number of individuals purported to be implicated by his father including Sarti, as well as Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Phillips, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, and William Harvey.[10][11] The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond, to avoid possible perjury charges.[9] According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain.[9] The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \"inconclusive\".[9]\n\nDavis, John H.

          "Lead": "Clay LaVergne Shaw (March 17, 1913 – August 15, 1974)[1] was an American businessman, military officer, and part-time contact of the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) of the CIA. Shaw is best known for being the only person brought to trial for involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Shaw was ultimately acquitted in 1969 after less than one hour of jury deliberation, but some conspiracy theorists continue to speculate on his possible involvement.",
          "Background": "Shaw, a native of Kentwood, Louisiana, was the son of Glaris Lenora Shaw,[2] a United States Marshal, and Alice Shaw.[3] His grandfather had been the sheriff of Tangipahoa Parish.[3] When Shaw was five, his family moved to New Orleans, where he eventually attended Warren Easton High School.[3]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1928, Shaw was hired by Western Union as manager of a local office in New Orleans. In 1935, Western Union transferred him to New York City where he became a district manager. While in New York, Shaw, who wanted to pursue a career as a writer, attended Columbia University. He later left Western Union to pursue a career in public relations, eventually accepting a position with the Keedick Lecture Bureau.[4]\n\nShaw enlisted in the United States Army at the start of World War II and was assigned to the Medical Corps as a private. He later received an officer's commission and was posted to England where he served briefly in a hospital unit. He was transferred to the Quartermaster Corps and served as secretary to the General Staff in England and after the Normandy invasion served in France and Belgium.[4] He was decorated by three nations: the United States with the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star, by France with the Croix de Guerre and named Chevalier de l'Ordre du Merite, and by Belgium named Knight of the Order of the Crown of Belgium. Shaw was honorably discharged from the United States Army as a major in 1946.[5]\n\nAfter World War II, Shaw helped start the International Trade Mart in New Orleans, which facilitated the sales of both domestic and imported goods. He was known locally for his efforts to preserve buildings in New Orleans' historic French Quarter.[6][7][8][9] Shaw was also a published playwright. The best-known of his works, Submerged (1929),[10] was co-written with H. Stuart Cottman[11][12][13] when both were still high-school students.[14][15]\n\nOn 9 May 1961 Shaw introduced Charles Cabell, Deputy Director of the CIA, at a Foreign Policy Association event in New Orleans.[16]",
          "Arrest and trial": "New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison prosecuted Shaw on the charge that he and a group of activists, including David Ferrie and Guy Banister, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the CIA in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Garrison had Shaw arrested on March 1, 1967.[17] By then Banister and Ferrie were both deceased, but Garrison believed that Shaw was the man named as \"Clay Bertrand\" in the Warren Commission Report. Garrison said that Shaw used the alias of Clay Bertrand in New Orleans's gay society.[18][19]\n\nDuring the trial, which took place in January and February 1969, Garrison called insurance salesman Perry Russo as his main witness.[20] Russo testified that he had attended a party at the apartment of anti-Castro activist David Ferrie. At the party, Russo said that Lee Harvey Oswald (who Russo said was introduced to him as \"Leon Oswald\"), Ferrie, and \"Clem Bertrand\" (who Russo identified in the courtroom as Shaw) had discussed assassinating Kennedy.[21] The conversation included plans for the \"triangulation of crossfire\" and alibis for the participants.[21]\n\nCritics of Garrison argue that his own records indicate that Russo's story had evolved over time.[22] A key source was the \"Sciambra Memo\", which recorded Assistant D.A. Andrew Sciambra's[23] first interview with Russo. The memo does not mention an \"assassination party\" and states that Russo met with Shaw on two occasions, neither of which occurred at the party.[24] On March 1, 1969, Shaw was acquitted less than an hour after the case went to the jury.[25][26][27]\n\nShaw denied any part of a conspiracy and said of the slain President: \"I was a great admirer of Kennedy. I thought he had given the nation a new turn after the rather drab Eisenhower years ... I felt he was vitally concerned about social issues, which concerned me also. I thought he had youth, imagination, style, and élan. All in all, I considered him a splendid president.\"[28]",
          "Death": "A heavy cigarette smoker for most of his life, Shaw died at the age of 61 at his home on August 15, 1974.[29] The cause of death was listed as metastatic lung cancer.[30] He was buried in Woodland Cemetery in Kentwood, Louisiana.[31]\n\nAt the time of his death, Shaw was engaged in a $5 million lawsuit against Garrison and members of an organization, Truth and Consequences Inc., that had financed Garrison's investigation.[32] As Shaw, a lifelong bachelor, had no heirs or surviving relatives, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the suit in 1978.[33]",
          "Later disclosures": "In 1979, Richard Helms, former Director of the CIA, testified under oath that Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contact Service (DCS) of the CIA, where Shaw volunteered information from his travels abroad, mostly to Latin America. He did so from 1948 till at least 1956.[34] Like Shaw, 150,000 Americans (including businessmen and journalists) had provided such information to the DCS by the mid-1970s \"on a nonclandestine basis\", and that \"such acts of cooperation should not be confused with an actual Agency relationship\".[34][35]",
          "In popular culture": "Tommy Lee Jones portrayed Shaw in Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK.[36] He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role.[37]\n\n^ \"Person Details for Clay Lavergne Shaw, \"U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007\" —\".

He is known for his research on shock, which initiated the current practice of giving saline to trauma and surgical patients. He operated on John Connally and Lee Harvey Oswald after the assassination of John F. Kennedy.",
          "Biography": "Born in Waco, Texas Shires was brought up in Dallas.[1][2] He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas, Texas) in 1942 and thereafter gained a B.S. degree from the University of Texas (1944), and an M.D. degree from the Southwestern Medical School, a school that opened five years earlier and is now called the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School (1948).[1][3]\n\nDuring his time as an undergraduate at Texas, Shires was initiated into the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.[4]\n\nHe was married to Robbie Jo Shires (Martin); the couple had a son and two daughters. Shires died of gastrointestinal cancer at Henderson, Nevada in 2007.[1][2]",
          "Career": "Shires served his residency at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas.[1][2] He worked at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda (1949–1950) and as a surgeon in the U.S. Navy on the hospital ship USS Haven (1953–55).[3] In 1957, he joined the faculty of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, becoming chair of surgery in 1961.[1][2] During his time in Dallas, he worked with the Dallas Fire Department to initiate one of the country's earliest paramedic systems.[1]\n\nIn 1974, he briefly served as chair of surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle.[1][3] Shires then became chair of surgery at Cornell University Medical College in New York in 1975, where he also served as dean and provost of medicine (1987–91).[1][2][3] At Cornell, he was instrumental in establishing a trauma centre and, in 1976, a burns centre. Now part of the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the burns centre has become an internationally recognised facility which is among the busiest in the USA, treating a thousand patients annually.[1][2] He was also involved in reorganising New York's emergency services.[2]\n\nFrom 1991 to 1995, Shires chaired the surgery department at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock.[1][2] He then served as director of the Trauma Institute at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, a post he held until his death.[1][3]",
          "Assassination of John F. Kennedy": "After President John F. Kennedy was shot in 1963, Shires was brought to Parkland Memorial Hospital from Galveston where he was speaking, by a NASA jet. Shires was then chief of surgery, and it was he who issued the statement that the president had been dead on arrival at the hospital. Shires successfully operated on John Connally, the Governor of Texas, who was also wounded in the assassination.[1][2] These events coincidentally occurred on Shires’ birthday. He later also operated unsuccessfully on gunman Lee Harvey Oswald after he was shot by Jack Ruby. Shires later coincidentally died on Oswald’s birthday.[1][5]",
          "Research and writing": "Shires' research in the 1960s on the physiology of shock showed that, contrary to the practice of the time, surgical patients and patients with trauma require intravenous saline solution.[1][2] According to Philip Barie (critical care and trauma chief at Cornell), this discovery \"changed the practice of medicine\" and was responsible for current medical practice.[1]\n\nHis other research areas included the treatment of burns;[6] management of the severe exfoliating disorders, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome;[7] physiology of haemorrhage;[8] responses to endotoxin;[9][10] and the epidemiology of suicide.[11]\n\nHe co-authored several books on surgery and trauma, including the well-known textbook Principles of Surgery, which was first published in 1969 and is currently in its seventh edition.[1][2]",
          "Awards and honors": "In 1985, Shires was ranked the top academic surgeon in the USA by Claude Organ, then president of the American College of Surgeons.[1] He was among the first to receive a MERIT (Method to Extend Research in Time) grant from the NIH/National Institute of General Medical Sciences in 1986, for his work on saline solutions in shock.[1][12]\n\nHis awards include the Surgeon's Award for Service to Safety (1984), Curtis P. Artz Memorial Award of the American Trauma Society (1984), Dr Rodman E. Sheen and Thomas G. Sheen Award (1985), Harvey Stuart Allen Distinguished Service Award of the American Burn Association (1988) and the Robert Danis Prize of the International Surgical Society (1993).[3]\n\nHe served as president of the American Surgical Association (1979–80), American College of Surgeons (1981–82), the US chapter of the International Surgical Society (1984–85) and the James IV Association of Surgeons (1987–91).[3][12] Shires was the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons (1982–92)[1] and editor of Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics (1982–94).[3] He also served on the editorial boards of many medical and surgical journals, including Annals of Surgery, Annual Review of Medicine, Archives of Surgery, American Journal of Surgery, Journal of Clinical Surgery and Journal of Trauma.[12]\n\nShires was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame in 1989 when it was created as part of the celebration of the school's 60th Anniversary.",

Kennedy's photographer during his White House years.[1]\n\nStoughton was present at the motorcade at which Kennedy was assassinated and subsequently took the only photograph on board Air Force One of Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn in as the next President.[2]",
          "Life and work": "Stoughton was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa, on January 18, 1920.\n\nDuring World War II, he was assigned to the First Motion Picture Unit.[3] He was a captain in the United States Army Signal Corps, when he was assigned to the White House Army Signal Agency. Stoughton's behind-the-scene pictures of John and Jacqueline and their children in their public and personal life were pivotal in shaping the public's view of the U.S. first family. He took more than 8,000 pictures of the family spanning the 34-month period beginning with Kennedy's inauguration and ending with his assassination.[4]\n\nStoughton took the only photograph ever published showing John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe together.[5] Stoughton was present at the motorcade at which Kennedy was assassinated, and was subsequently the only photographer on board Air Force One when Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the next President.[6] Stoughton knew it was \"tasteless,\" but suggested a photograph needed to be made of the \"history-making moment ... and I think we should have it.\"[7] Kenneth T. Walsh even agreed and said of Stoughton's picture that Air Force One \"has become associated with incredibly powerful images\" and \"a symbol of the country and a reminder of history.\"[8] His photograph, the most famous ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft,[2][9] depicts Johnson raising his hand in oath as he stood between his wife Lady Bird Johnson and a still blood-spattered Jacqueline Kennedy.[10] Stoughton recounted this event and his service as White House photographer during Johnson's first two years in office in an oral history contributed to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.[11][12]\n\nFrom 1967–1973, Stoughton served as the chief still photographer of the National Park Service.[13]\n\nStoughton appeared as a contestant on the May 29, 1987 episode of the game show Classic Concentration, on the date that Kennedy would have turned 70 years old.\n\nIn 2007, Stoughton appeared on the television series Antiques Roadshow as part of the LBJ Centennial where he recounted his story and presented prints of his photographs from his personal collection, including a print of his photograph of Johnson being sworn in that Johnson had signed, and a photograph of Johnson in the Oval Office as he signed the photo of his swearing in.[14] All the items together appraised for $75,000. Two years after his death a large collection of his photographs was sold at auction. It included the picture of Johnson's inauguration, and fetched $151,000.[15]\n\nHe died in Merritt Island, Florida,[16][17] and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.[18]\n\n^ Trivedi 2004.

Kennedy.",
          "Early life and military service": "When still a child, his family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On October 5, 1942, in his senior year of high school, 17-year-old Frank Angelo Fiorini joined the United States Marine Corps and served under Colonel \"Red Mike\" Merritt A. Edson in the First Marine Raider Battalion in the Pacific Theater during the Second World War.[3]\n\n\"On April 14, 1942, William Donovan, as Coordinator of Information (forerunner of the Office of Strategic Services), activated units charged with gathering intelligence, harassing the Japanese through guerrilla actions, identifying targets for the Army Air Force to bomb, and rescuing downed Allied airmen.\"[4] This was what led to Stilwell's Chinese forces, Wingate's Raiders, and Merrill's Marauders involvement in the war,[5] and Frank got trained in guerrilla tactics and gathering intelligence, which became useful in his later events.[citation needed]\n\nHonorably discharged as a corporal in 1945, he enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute but left college and joined the Norfolk Police Department on June 5, 1946.[6] He soon discovered a corrupt payoff system and brought it to the attention of his superiors, who told him to overlook the illegal activities. On October 5, 1946, he had a confrontation with his sergeant and resigned the same day. For the next 18 months, he managed the Havana-Madrid tavern in Norfolk that catered to foreigners, mostly Cuban merchant seamen.[citation needed]\n\nOn November 9, 1947, Fiorini joined the United States Naval Reserve at the Norfolk Naval Air Station and learned to fly while still working at the tavern. He was honorably discharged on August 30, 1948, and joined the United States Army the next day. He was sent immediately to West Berlin, where the USSR had closed the land routes during the Berlin Blockade, and he became a member of General Lucius Clay's honor guard. Two weeks after the USSR reopened the land routes on May 11, 1949, Fiorini was honorably discharged. As a Marine Raider, Fiorini had worked behind enemy lines gathering intelligence, and during his Army tenure in Berlin and Heidelberg, he had a top secret clearance and worked in an intelligence unit whose primary target was the Soviet Union. Fiorini started to believe Russia was a threat, and he became a lifelong militant. Returning to Norfolk in 1952, he took a job managing the Cafe Society tavern, then partnered with its owner, Milton Bass, to co-purchase and manage The Top Hat Nightclub in Virginia Beach.[7]\n\nOn September 23, 1952, Frank Fiorini filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk, Virginia, to change his name to Frank Anthony Sturgis, adopting the surname of his stepfather Ralph Sturgis, whom his mother had married in 1937. His new name closely resembled that of Hank Sturgis, the fictional hero of E. Howard Hunt's 1949 novel, Bimini Run, whose life parallels Frank Sturgis's life from 1942 to 1949 in certain salient respects.[8]",
          "Moves to Cuba, joins Castro forces": "In 1956, Sturgis moved to Cuba, and went to Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama and Honduras. Sturgis moved to Miami in 1957, where the Cuban wife of his uncle Angelo Vona introduced him to former Cuban president Carlos Prío, who joined with other Cubans opposing dictator Fulgencio Batista to plot their return to power. Now Frank had gotten together with an old friend, Richard Sanderlin who was also a Norfolk, Virginia native. Once they had relocated to Miami, Florida, they began an arms and munition smuggling operation into Cuba, bound for the rebels of Fidel Castro. They were sending money to Mexico to support Fidel Castro, whose July 26 Movement had arranged a meeting between CIA Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick and their representatives in 1957 by Pepín Bosch, an executive of the Bacardi Corporation.[9] Prio asked Sturgis to go to Cuba to join up with Castro and to report back to the exiled powers in Miami, so he went down and met with Castro.[10] While Richard Sanderlin traveled to the Sierra Maestra Mountains in Oriente Province Cuba, where he began training the Castro rebels, in military strategy, tactics, weapon handling, and hand to hand fighting.\n\nIn 1958, Frank made contact with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Cuba at the US Consulate in Santiago. He worked as an informer for the agency with his control officer Sam Jenis. Sturgis also became involved running guns to Cuba,[2] along with mobster Santo Trafficante,[11] and not surprisingly was arrested for illegal possession of arms, but released without charge. In 1959, Sturgis had contact with casinos in Cuba and some say met Lewis McWillie, mobster Traficante's man in Cuba, and the manager of the Tropicana Casino who by his own testimony[12] was a known acquaintance of Jack Ruby.[13]\n\nSturgis met up with Castro and his 400 rebels in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Sturgis offered to train Castro's troops in guerrilla warfare. Castro accepted the offer, but he also had an immediate need for guns and ammunition, so Sturgis became a gunrunner.[2] Using money from anti-Batista Cuban exiles in Miami and some suspect the CIA, Sturgis purchased boatloads of weapons and ammunition from CIA weapons expert Samuel Cummings' International Armament Corporation in Alexandria, Virginia. Sturgis explained later that he chose to throw in with Castro rather than Prío because Fidel was a soldier, a man of action, whereas Prío was a politician, more a man of words.[14]\n\nIn March 1958, Sturgis opened a training camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he taught Che Guevara and other 26th of July Movement rebel soldiers guerrilla warfare.[15] When Castro seized power, a rebel firing squad on San Juan Hill executed 71 of their opponents on January 11, 1959, into an awaiting 40-foot (12.2 m) ditch that had been opened with a bulldozer. Although Sturgis did not take part in the execution, he was photographed afterwards holding a rifle on top of the covered mass grave.[16]\n\nHis friend Richard Sanderlin, completed the training of Raul Castros Second Front, and led a guerrilla band into combat operations against the Cuban army of Batista.\n\nCastro then appointed Sturgis gambling czar and director of security and intelligence for the air force, in addition to his position as a captain in July 26 Movement.[17] Sturgis went to Miami on June 2, 1959, with Alan McDonald while \"supervising the investigation of several American gamblers with criminal records that operate casinos in Havana.\" They requested from Metropolitan Criminal Intelligence Supervisor Frank Kappel information on \"Meyer and Jake Lansky, Joe Silesi aka Joe Rivers and Santos Trafficante,\" that was provided to them six days later after the Cuban government sent an official written request.[18] He was introduced to two men that were transported to Cuba from Venezuela to assist in the organization of the revolution and Frank saw they were clearly communist. He began to sound out those that he knew were anti-communist including Camilo Cienfuegos, as he knew leaders like Raúl Castro and Che Guevara were communist, but he was unsure about Fidel Castro. Sturgis defected the following month with Revolutionary Air Force chief Commandant Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz[19] and they joined the anti-Castro exile opposition.\n\nSturgis participated with him a few months later in an anti-Castro leaflet-dropping raid over Cuba. Sturgis formed the Anti-Communist Brigade which Hans Tanner in his book \"Counter-Revolutionary Agent\", says the organization was \"being financed by dispossessed hotel and gambling owners\" from Cuba. The Border Patrol in Miami reported that Sturgis was involved in a CIA operation being financed by Sergio Rojas (former Cuban Ambassador to Great Britain) to overthrow Castro. It has been claimed, with little in the way of evidence, that Sturgis was involved in helping the CIA organize the Bay of Pigs Invasion, for whose ultimate failure he blamed President Kennedy. Sturgis recruited 19 year old Marita Lorenz,[20] who was close to Fidel Castro, and she took CIA pills,[21] which she hid in her face cream, to poison Castro, but the plot failed.[22] According to Lorenz, she met Sturgis again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 with others planning a big event.[23] Lorenz stated that she joined Sturgis traveling to Dallas after the meeting.[23] Lorenz later testified about this Kennedy assassination plot before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).[24]\n\nSturgis was claimed to be a member of Operation 40, a CIA-sponsored counterintelligence group composed of Cuban exiles.[25] The group was formed to seize control of the Cuban government after the Bay of Pigs Invasion.[26] The operation was concentrating on Cuba and were operating out of Mexico.\n\nDespite his claimed involvement in numerous CIA sponsored operations including the Bay of Pigs invasion, the 1975 Rockefeller Commission succinctly states that \"Frank Sturgis was not an employee or agent of the CIA either in 1963 or at any other time.\"[27]",
          "Watergate burglary 1972": "On June 17, 1972, Sturgis, Virgilio González, Eugenio Martínez, Bernard Barker and James W. McCord, Jr. were arrested while installing electronic listening devices in the national Democratic Party campaign offices located at the Watergate office complex in Washington. The White House office telephone number of CIA officer E. Howard Hunt was found in address books of the burglars. Reporters were able to link the break-in to the White House. The burglars had successfully entered into the same location several weeks earlier, but returned to fix a malfunctioning device and to photograph more documents. Bob Woodward, a reporter working for The Washington Post was told by a source (Deep Throat) who was employed by the government that senior aides of President Richard Nixon had paid the burglars to obtain information about his political opponents.\n\nSturgis was portrayed in All the President's Men, the 1976 film retelling the events of the Watergate scandal, by Ron Hale.",
          "Prison and later investigations": "In January 1973, Sturgis, Hunt, Gonzalez, Martinez, Barker, G. Gordon Liddy and James W. McCord were convicted of conspiracy, burglary and wiretapping.\n\nSturgis was convicted in 1973 with Max Gonzalez and Jerry Buchanan in a federal court in Miami (73-597-CR-CA) of transporting cars stolen in Texas into Mexico.[28] This prompted Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Acting Regional Director David W. Costa to send a letter to Judge C. Clyde Atkins on March 10, 1975, indicating that Sturgis had been covertly cooperating with the DEA.[29] Sturgis served 14 months in the minimum security federal prison in Eglin, Florida.\n\nAfter leaving prison, Sturgis served as a Miami police informant and continued providing intelligence on the anti-Castro activities of Dr. Orlando Bosch.[30]\n\nSt. George's article was published in True magazine in August 1974. Sturgis claims that the Watergate burglars had been instructed to find a particular document in the Democratic Party offices. This was a \"secret memorandum from the Castro government\" that included details of CIA covert actions. Sturgis said \"that the Castro government suspected the CIA did not tell the whole truth about these operations even to American political leaders\".[31] In response to Sturgis' repeated braggadocio to the news media, the CIA issued a public statement on May 30, 1975, indicating that he had never been connected with them \"in any way.\"[32]\n\nIn an interview with New York Daily News reporter Paul Meskil on June 20, 1975, Sturgis stated, \"I was a spy. I was involved in assassination plots and conspiracies to overthrow several foreign governments including Cuba, Panama, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. I smuggled arms and men into Cuba for Castro and against Castro. I broke into intelligence files. I stole and photographed secret documents. That's what spies do.\"\n\nSturgis was denied a pardon by President Jimmy Carter.[33]",
          "JFK conspiracy allegations": "Sturgis has been the subject of various allegations regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He also made claims that other individuals were involved in the assassination of Kennedy.",
          "Early allegations: Sturgis as one of the \"three tramps\"": "The Dallas Morning News, the Dallas Times Herald, and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram photographed three transients under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination of Kennedy.[34] The men later became known as the \"three tramps\".[35] According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that these men were involved in a conspiracy originated from theorist Richard E. Sprague who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to Jim Garrison during his investigation of Clay Shaw.[35] Appearing before a nationwide audience on the December 31, 1968, episode of The Tonight Show, Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination.[35] Later, in 1974, assassination researchers Alan J. Weberman and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were Watergate burglars Hunt and Sturgis.[36] Comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis in 1975 after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield.[36] Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage and his charges were reported in Rolling Stone and Newsweek.[36][37][38]\n\nThe Rockefeller Commission reported in 1975 that they investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the CIA, participated in the assassination of Kennedy.[39] The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the \"derelicts\" bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis \"were not shown to have any qualification in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman\".[40] Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, \"a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis\" with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men were Hunt or Sturgis.[41] In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the \"tramps\" with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Chrisman.[42] According to the committee, only Chrisman resembled any of the tramps but determined that he was not to be in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.[42] In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963, arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney.[43] According to the arrest reports, the three men were \"taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot\", detained as \"investigative prisoners\", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.[43]",
          "Sturgis makes his own allegations": "In 1976, Sturgis claimed that he was assigned to investigate any possible role that Cuban exiles may have played in the assassination of Kennedy.[44] He stated that his investigation revealed that ten weeks prior to the assassination, Jack Ruby met with Fidel Castro in Havana, Cuba to discuss \"the removal of the President\" in order to neutralize the threat of invasion by the United States.[44][45] According to Sturgis, others at the meeting included Raúl Castro, Che Guevara, Ramiro Valdés and \"an Argentine woman who is believed to have been a Russian KGB agent\".[44][45] He said that Ruby had also made several trips to Havana in the months before the assassination in order to arrange deals in which arms would be sold to Cuba and in which illegal drugs from Cuba would be smuggled into the United States.[44] Sturgis also claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the conspiracy, and that other governments either were involved in the conspiracy or knew of the conspiracy.[44] He said that his investigation did not reveal that Cuban exiles were involved in the assassination.[44]\n\nSturgis declined to specifically identify the sources of his information, but noted he said that they included members of the \"anti-Castro Cuban underground.\"[44][45] He further claimed that associates of his involved in intelligence had independently confirmed his report.[44][45] According to Sturgis, his report was made in early 1964 and that it was given to \"certain American intelligence agencies, including the Senate Internal Security Committee.\"[45] He said that he did not know if it had been forwarded to the Warren Commission.[44] Similarly, Sturgis said that information about the 1964 reports had been provided to the Rockefeller Commission as well as the Church Committee's intelligence subcommittee chaired by Richard Schweiker, but that he did not know if they received the actual reports.[44][45]\n\nSturgis stated he was revealing that he made the reports in order to refute \"the leftist element in the country\" who claimed the CIA was involved in the assassination of Kennedy.[46] Jack Ruby's brother, Earl, responded to the allegations as \"outlandish,\" \"ridiculous,\" and \"absolutely false\".[47][48]\n\nIn a 1977 television interview conducted by Bill O'Reilly, Sturgis indicated that Alexander Butterfield had notable \"associations\" with CIA officials, associating himself with the position taken by L. Fletcher Prouty who had made headlines nationwide with his allegation that Butterfield was operating on behalf of the CIA.[49]",
          "Marita Lorenz: Sturgis with Oswald": "In September 1977, Marita Lorenz told Paul Meskil of the New York Daily News that she met Oswald in the fall of 1963 at an Operation 40 safe house in the Little Havana section of Miami.[23] According to Lorenz, she met him again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 in the house of Orlando Bosch, with Sturgis, Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz, and two other Cubans present.[23] She said the men studied Dallas street maps and that she suspected that they were planning on raiding an arsenal.[23] Lorenz stated that she joined the men traveling to Dallas in two cars and carrying \"rifles and scopes\", but flew back to Miami the day after they arrived.[23] In response to her allegations, Sturgis said he did not recall ever meeting Oswald and reiterated his previous denials of being involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.[23]\n\nOn October 31, 1977, Sturgis was arrested in Lorenz's apartment after Lorenz told police that Sturgis threatened her in an attempt to force her to change her testimony to federal investigators.[50] In an interview with Steve Dunleavy of the New York Post shortly after he posted bail, Sturgis said that he believed communist agents had pressured Lorenz into making the accusations against him.[51] Later that week in Manhattan Criminal Court, charges against Sturgis were dropped after the prosecutor told the judge that his office found no evidence of coercion or harassment.[50] Recapping the series of events, Timothy Crouse of The Village Voice described Sturgis and Lorenz as \"two of the most notoriously unreliable sources in America\".[52]",
          "Posthumous allegations: Hunt's \"deathbed confession\"": "After the death of Hunt in 2007, John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy.[53][54] In the April 5, 2007, issue of Rolling Stone, John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father including Sturgis, as well as Cord Meyer, David Sánchez Morales, David Atlee Phillips, William Harvey and an assassin he termed \"French gunman grassy knoll\" who many presume was Lucien Sarti.[54][55] The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond, to avoid possible perjury charges.[53] According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain.[53] The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \"inconclusive\".[53]",
          "Portugal, 1980: Camarate Affair": "Sturgis is also linked to the assassination, on December 4, 1980, of Portuguese prime minister Francisco de Sá Carneiro and 6 other people aboard a Cessna aircraft, in what became known as the Camarate affair. He was named by two of his alleged accomplices, Fernando Farinha Simões and José Esteves, in a written confession,[56] as the person who pressed the button of the detonator to activate the bomb on the plane.",
          "Later life": "In 1979, Sturgis traveled to Angola to help rebels fighting the communist government, which was supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union, and to teach guerrilla warfare. In 1981 he went to Honduras to train the US backed Contras who were fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government, which was supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union; the Army of El Salvador; and the Honduras death squads. He made a second trip to Angola and trained rebels in the Angolan bush for Holden Roberto. He interacted with Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal. In 1989 he visited Yassir Arafat in Tunis. Arafat shared elements of his peace plan, and Sturgis was debriefed by the CIA on his return.[57]\n\nIn an obituary published December 5, 1993, The New York Times quoted Sturgis' lawyer, Ellis Rubin, as saying that Sturgis died of cancer a week after he was admitted to a veterans' hospital in Miami, five days shy of his 69th birthday. It was reported that doctors diagnosed lung cancer that had spread to his kidneys, and that he was survived by a wife, Jan, and a daughter named Autumn.[1]\n\n^\na b \"Frank A.

          "Lead": "Kerry Wendell Thornley (April 17, 1938 – November 28, 1998)[1][2] was an American author. He is known as the co-founder (along with childhood friend Greg Hill) of Discordianism,[1][2] in which context he is usually known as Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst or simply Lord Omar.[1] He and Hill authored the religion's text Principia Discordia, Or, How I Found Goddess, and What I Did to Her When I Found Her. Thornley also was known for his 1962 manuscript The Idle Warriors, which was inspired by the activities of his acquaintance Lee Harvey Oswald before the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy.[3]\n\nThornley was highly active in the countercultural publishing scene, writing for a number of underground magazines and newspapers, and self-publishing many one-page (or broadsheet) newsletters of his own. One such newsletter called Zenarchy was published in the 1960s under the pen name Ho Chi Zen.[1] Zenarchy is described in the introduction of the collected volume as \"the social order which springs from meditation\", and \"A noncombative, nonparticipatory, no-politics approach to anarchy intended to get the serious student thinking.\"\n\nRaised Mormon, in adulthood Kerry shifted his ideological focus frequently, in rivalry with any serious countercultural figure of the 1960s. Among the subjects he closely scrutinized throughout his life were atheism, anarchism, Objectivism, autarchism (he attended Robert LeFevre's Freedom School), neo-paganism, Kerista,[4] Buddhism, and the memetic inheritor of Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius.",
          "Personal life": "Kerry Wendell Thornley was born on April 17, 1938, in Los Angeles to Kenneth and Helen Thornley. He had two younger brothers, Dick and Tom.[5]\n\nThornley attended California High School in Whittier, California.[6]\n\nOn Saturday, December 11, 1965, Kerry married Cara Leach at Wayfarers Chapel in Palos Verdes, California. They had one son, Kreg Thornley, born in 1969. They later divorced. Kreg was a photographer, painter, musician and film maker.[5][7]",
          "Military life": "Having already been a reservist in the U.S. Marine Corps for about two years, Thornley had been summoned to active duty in 1958 at age 20, soon after completing his freshman year at the University of Southern California.[6] According to Principia Discordia, it was around this time that he and Greg Hill—alias Malaclypse the Younger or Mal-2—shared their first Eristic vision in a bowling alley in their hometown of Whittier, California.\n\nIn early 1959, Thornley served for a short time in the same radar operator unit as Lee Harvey Oswald at MCAS El Toro in Santa Ana, California.[6] Both men had shared a common interest in society, culture, literature and politics, and whenever duty placed them together, had discussed such topics as George Orwell's famous novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and the philosophy of Marxism, particularly Oswald's interest in the latter.[8]\n\nWhile aboard a troopship returning to the United States from duty in Japan (some time after the two men parted ways as a result of routine reassignment), Thornley read of Oswald's autumn 1959 defection to the Soviet Union in the U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes.[9]",
          "1960s": "In February 1962, Thornley completed The Idle Warriors,[10] which has the historical distinction of being the only book written about Lee Harvey Oswald before Kennedy's assassination in 1963.[1] Due to the serendipitous nature of Thornley's choice of literary subject matter, he was called to testify before the Warren Commission in Washington, D.C., on May 18, 1964.[1][10][11] The Commission subpoenaed a copy of the manuscript and stored it in the National Archives, and the book remained unpublished until 1991.[11] In 1965, Thornley published another book titled Oswald, generally defending the \"Oswald-as-lone-assassin\" conclusion of the Warren Commission.\n\nIn January 1968, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, certain there had been a New Orleans–based conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy, subpoenaed Thornley to appear before a grand jury, questioning him about his relationship with Oswald and his knowledge of other figures Garrison believed to be connected to the assassination.[1][11][12] Thornley sought a cancellation of this subpoena on which he had to appear before the Circuit Court.[13] Garrison charged Thornley with perjury after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald in any manner since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison's successor Harry Connick Sr.\n\nThornley claimed that, during his initial two-year sojourn in New Orleans, he had numerous meetings with two mysterious middle-aged men named \"Gary Kirstein\" and \"Slim Brooks\". According to his account, they had detailed discussions on numerous subjects ranging from the mundane to the exotic, and bordering sometimes on bizarre. Among these was the subject of how one might assassinate President Kennedy, whose beliefs and policies the aspiring novelist deeply disliked at the time. Later, the former Marine came to believe that \"Gary Kirstein\" had in reality been senior CIA officer and future Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt, and \"Slim Brooks\" to have been Jerry Milton Brooks, a member of the 1960s right-wing activist group The Minutemen. Guy Banister, another Minutemen member in New Orleans, had been accused by Garrison of involvement in the assassination and was allegedly connected to Lee Harvey Oswald through the Fair Play for Cuba Committee leaflet.[14][15] Thornley also claimed that \"Kirstein\" and Brooks had accurately predicted Richard M. Nixon's accession to the presidency six years before it happened, as well as anticipating the rise of the 1960s counterculture and the subsequent emergence of Charles Manson and what became his cult following. This led Thornley to believe that the US government had somehow been involved, directly or indirectly, in creating and/or supporting these events, personages and phenomena.[16][17]\n\nAfter Shaw was acquitted, Thornley said he wanted Garrison to bring him to trial in order to clear his name.[18]",
          "Later life and death": "For the next 30 years, Thornley traveled and lived all over the United States and was involved in a variety of activities, ranging from editing underground newspapers to attending graduate school. He spent most of the remainder of his life in the Little Five Points neighborhood of Atlanta.[1] During this time, he maintained a free series of fliers titled \"Out of Order.\" This single page, double sided Xeroxed periodical was distributed in the Little Five Points area. Thornley became increasingly paranoid and distrustful in the wake of his experiences during the 1960s, both by his own accounts and those of personal acquaintances. For a time, Thornley wrote a regular column in the zine Factsheet Five until editor Mike Gunderloy stopped publishing the magazine. Struggling with illness in his final days, Kerry Thornley died of cardiac arrest in Atlanta on November 28, 1998, at the age of 60.[1] The following morning, 23 people attended a Buddhist memorial service in his honor. His body had been cremated, and the ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean. Shortly before his death, Thornley reportedly said he'd felt \"like a tired child home from a very wild circus\", a reference to a passage by Greg Hill from Principia Discordia:\n\nAnd so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is that we play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder them, and so it shall be that Non-existence shall take us back from Existence, and that nameless Spirituality shall return to Void, like a tired child home from a very wild circus.",

          "Lead": "The three tramps are three men photographed by several Dallas-area newspapers under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Since the mid-1960s, various allegations have been made about the identities of the men and their involvement in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. The three men were later identified from Dallas Police Department records as Gus Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John Gedney.",
          "Early allegations": "The Dallas Morning News, the Dallas Times Herald, and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram photographed three transients under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination.[1] The men later became known as the \"three tramps\".[2] According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that these men were involved in a conspiracy originated from researcher Richard E. Sprague who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to Jim Garrison during his investigation of Clay Shaw.[2] Appearing before a nationwide audience on the January 31, 1968, episode of The Tonight Show, Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination.[2]",
          "Later allegations: E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis": "Later, in 1974, assassination researchers Alan J. Weberman and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were Watergate burglars E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis.[3] Comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis in 1975 after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield.[3] Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage and his charges were reported in Rolling Stone and Newsweek.[3][4]\n\nThe Rockefeller Commission reported in 1975 that they investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), participated in the assassination of Kennedy.[5] The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the \"derelicts\" bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis, \"were not shown to have any qualification in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman\".[6] Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, \"a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis\" with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men were Hunt or Sturgis.[7]\n\nIn 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the \"tramps\" with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Crisman.[8] According to the Committee, only Crisman resembled any of the tramps; but the same Committee determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.[8]\n\nAccording to Mark Lane, Sturgis became involved with Marita Lorenz in 1985, who later identified Sturgis as a gunman in the assassination.[9]",
          "Other allegations: Charles Harrelson, Charles Rogers, and Chauncey Holt": "In September 1982, contract killer Charles Harrelson, while wanted for the murder of federal judge John H. Wood Jr., \"confessed\" to killing Wood and President Kennedy, during a six-hour standoff with police in which he was reportedly high on cocaine.[10][11] Joseph Chagra, the brother of Jamiel Chagra, testified during Harrelson's trial that Harrelson claimed to have shot Kennedy and drew maps to show where he was hiding during the assassination.[12] Chagra said that he did not believe Harrelson's claim, and the AP reported that the FBI \"apparently discounted any involvement by Harrelson in the Kennedy assassination\".[12]\n\nAccording to Jim Marrs's 1989 book Crossfire, Harrelson is believed to be the youngest and tallest of the \"tramps\" by many assassination researchers.[13] Marrs stated that Harrelson was involved \"with criminals connected to intelligence agencies and the military\"[14] and suggested that he was connected to Jack Ruby through Russell Douglas Matthews, a third party with links to organized crime who was known to both Harrelson and Ruby.[14]\n\nIn September 1991, private investigators John Craig and Philip Rogers, who were working on a book about an unsolved murder case, claimed that Charles Rogers, who disappeared in 1965 after the dismembered bodies of his parents were found in a refrigerator, was a CIA operative who was identified by his friends and relatives as one of the \"tramps\".[15] According to the Houston Chronicle, a homicide detective who worked on the original murder case of Rogers's parents described the scenario as \"far-fetched\".[15]\n\nThree months later, in a 1991 Newsweek article about Oliver Stone's JFK, Chauncey Holt received national attention for various claims that he made regarding the assassination of President Kennedy, including that he was one of three CIA operatives photographed as the \"tramps\".[16][17][18] Holt stated that he was with Harrelson in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.[19] According to Holt, he was ordered to Dallas to deliver phony Secret Service credentials, but was not involved in killing Kennedy nor did he have knowledge of who did.[16][17]\n\nJohn Craig and Philip Rogers's 1992 book The Man on the Grassy Knoll eventually connected Charles Harrelson, Charles Rogers, and Chauncey Holt by alleging that they were the three tramps photographed in Dealey Plaza.[20] According to that book, Harrelson and Rogers were sharpshooters on the grassy knoll who were assisted by Holt.[20]",
          "Historical explanation: Gus Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John Gedney": "In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered November 22, 1963 arrest records the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney.[21] According to the arrest reports, the three men were \"taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot\", detained as \"investigative prisoners\", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.[21]\n\nAn immediate search for the three men by the FBI and others was prompted by an article by Ray and Mary La Fontaine on the front page of the February 9, 1992, Houston Post.[21] Less than a month later, the FBI reported that Abrams was dead and that interviews with Gedney and Doyle revealed no new information about the assassination.[22] According to Doyle, the three men had spent the night before the assassination in a local homeless shelter where they showered and ate before heading back to the railyard.[21]\n\nInterviewed by A Current Affair in 1992, Doyle said that he was aware of the allegations and did not come forward for fear of being implicated in the assassination.[21] He added: \"I am a plain guy, a simple country boy, and that's the way I want to stay. I wouldn't be a celebrity for $10 million.\"[21] Gedney independently affirmed Doyle's account,[21] and a researcher who tracked down Abrams' sister confirmed that Abrams lived the life of an itinerant train hopper and had died in 1987.[23]\n\nDespite the Dallas Police Department's 1989 identifications of the three tramps as being Doyle, Gedney and Abrams and the lack of evidence connecting them to the assassination, some researchers have continued to maintain other identifications for the tramps and to theorize that they may have been connected to the crime.[24] Photographs of the three at the time of their arrest have fueled speculation as to their identities as they appeared to be well-dressed and clean-shaven, unusual for rail riders. Some researchers also thought it suspicious that the Dallas police had quickly released the tramps from custody, apparently without investigating whether they might have witnessed anything significant related to the assassination,[a] and that Dallas police claimed to have lost the records of their arrests[26][better source needed] as well as their mugshots and fingerprints.[27]\n\nBabushka Lady\nBadge Man\nUmbrella man (JFK assassination)\n\nBabushka Lady\n\nBadge Man\n\nUmbrella man (JFK assassination)\n\nHedegaarde, Erik (5 April 2007). \"The Last Confession of E.

He participated in two notable U.S. court cases of the 20th century: the prosecution of Jack Ruby for killing Lee Harvey Oswald, and the U.S. Supreme Court case that held abortion was a constitutional right, Roe v. Wade. In addition, Wade was district attorney when Randall Dale Adams, the subject of the 1988 documentary film The Thin Blue Line, was wrongfully convicted in the murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. After his term and death, he was criticised for his corruption, ranging from wrongful convictions, to altitudes and certain comments on race, in addition to some decisions such as execution of innocent men.",
          "Early life": "Wade, one of 11 children,[2] was born in Rockwall County, Texas, outside Dallas. Wade, along with five of his seven brothers, entered the legal profession. Shortly after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, in 1939, Wade joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation,[1] headed by J. Edgar Hoover. Wade's assignment as special agent was to investigate espionage cases along the US East Coast and in South America. Wade served in the US Navy during World War II, participating in the invasions of the Philippines and Okinawa.",
          "Career": "He was first elected Rockwall County Attorney. In 1947, Wade joined the Dallas County District Attorney's Office. He won election to the top job four years later, a position he held for 36 years, until his retirement in 1987.",
          "John F. Kennedy assassination": "On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in downtown Dallas, just blocks from Wade's office in the Dallas County Courthouse.[3]\n\nWade lost the opportunity to try Lee Harvey Oswald for the killing of Kennedy and the murder of Officer J.D. Tippit when Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby murdered Oswald two days later; Wade became known nationally for prosecuting Ruby for Oswald's murder. Wade closely supervised the Ruby trial, but he appointed his assistant, William Alexander, to conduct the courtroom proceedings.[4]\n\nWade and Alexander confronted Ruby's lawyers, famed trial lawyer Melvin Belli and Texas counsellor Joe Tonahill, in a lengthy trial that concluded on March 14, 1964, with a verdict for Ruby of \"guilty of murder with malice.\" The jury had deliberated for less than three hours before arriving at its decision, and it recommended a death penalty.[5]",

Wade": "Wade, as Dallas County district attorney, was the named defendant when attorneys Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee mounted a 1970 constitutional challenge to the Texas criminal statutes prohibiting doctors from performing abortions. Norma McCorvey (\"Jane Roe\"), a single woman, was signed up as the representative plaintiff. The challenge sought both a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face, and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes. The lower court refused to grant Roe's desired injunction, but declared the criminal abortion statutes were void.\n\nBoth sides cross-appealed. The case worked its way through the appellate process, culminating in the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made all first trimester abortions legal throughout the United States.",
          "Later life": "Despite the loss of Roe v. Wade and its unpopularity with conservative voters, Wade himself was not blamed, and his political career did not suffer. He continued to serve in office for an additional 14 years, and he remained a fixture around the new Crowley Courts Building, where members of the Dallas Bar called him \"the Chief\". In 1995, the Henry Wade Juvenile Justice Center was named in his honor, and in 2000, shortly before his death from Parkinson's disease, Texas Lawyer magazine named him as one of the 102 most influential lawyers of the 20th century.[2]",
          "Legacy": "Wade once again gained national attention in 1988 with the release of Errol Morris's documentary film The Thin Blue Line. The documentary tells the story of Randall Dale Adams' 1977 conviction for the murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. Adams was sentenced to death for the crime. The execution was scheduled for May 8, 1979, but US Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., ordered a stay only three days before the scheduled date. Instead of conducting a new trial, Governor Bill Clements commuted Adams's sentence to life in prison. Adams was exonerated in 1988, after serving 12 years in prison. Similar cases of exonerated men have recently arisen, putting the legality of Wade's practices in question.[citation needed]\n\nIn a January 1964 Dallas Times Herald, Wade's wife was quoted: \"I’d be afraid to drink a glass of light wine and then drive to the drugstore...If the police stopped me, I know what Henry would do.\"[6] Several articles later noted that a 1963 internal memo in Wade's office advised against \"Jews, Negroes, Dagos, Mexicans or a member of any minority race\" from serving on a jury.[7] In 1969, Jon Sparling, one of Wade's top assistants, wrote a training manual warning against picking, among others, \"free-thinkers\" and \"extremely overweight people,\" and said, \"You are not looking for a fair juror but rather a strong, biased and sometimes hypocritical individual who believes that defendants are different from them.\"[8]\n\nAs of July 2008, 15 persons convicted during Wade's term as Dallas County district attorney have been exonerated of the crimes of which they were convicted in light of new DNA evidence. Because of the culture of the department to \"convict at all costs,\" more innocent people are suspected to have been falsely imprisoned.[9] Project Innocence Texas has more than 250 cases under examination.\n\nCraig Watkins, the first black American DA for Dallas Country, described Wade's tenure as having \"a cowboy kind of mentality and the reality is that kind of approach is archaic, racist, elitist and arrogant.\"[10] In Wade’s final year in office, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the death sentence of a black man, Thomas Miller-El, ruling that blacks were excluded from the jury. Cited in Miller-El’s appeal was a manual for prosecutors that Wade wrote in 1969 and was used for more than a decade. It gave instructions on how to keep minorities off juries. Before Wade's death, DNA evidence was used for the first time to reverse a Dallas County conviction; David Shawn Pope, found guilty of rape in 1986, who had spent 15 years in prison.[11] Watkins said in a 2010 interview in The Guardian that officers from his own jurisdiction \"were taken aback because we were calling in to question the work they had done for all these years. It was the same among some folks in this office. They were afraid of the consequences of this Pandora's box being opened.\"[12] Lenell Geter, a black engineer, was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life in prison. After Geter had spent more than a year behind bars, Wade agreed to a new trial, then dropped the charges in 1983 amid reports of shoddy evidence and allegations Geter was singled out because of his race.[13] According to a 2016, article, Wade was responsible for the conviction and execution of a black man called Tommy Lee Walker. Former Dallas assistant district attorney Edward Gray wrote the 2010 book Henry Wade's Tough Justice which discussed the miscarriages of justice during Wade's tenure, noting that Wade's office conviction rate of innocent defendants was ten times the national average. Gray stated that \"Henry Wade wouldn't intentionally try to convict someone he knew to be innocent...but even in cases where evidence was weak, he would go all out, go for broke, be super-competitive.\"[14]\n\n^\na b c Wolfgang Saxon (March 2, 2001). \"Henry Wade, Prosecutor in National Spotlight, Dies at 86\".

          "Lead": "Edwin Anderson Walker (November 10, 1909 – October 31, 1993) was a United States Army major general who served in World War II and the Korean War. Walker resigned his commission during 1959, but Eisenhower refused to accept his resignation and gave Walker a new command of the 24th Infantry Division in Augsburg, Germany. Walker again resigned his commission in 1961 after being publicly and formally admonished by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for allegedly referring to Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman as \"pink\" in print and for violating the Hatch Act of 1939 by attempting to influence the votes of his troops. President John F. Kennedy accepted his resignation, making Walker the only US general to resign during the 20th century.\n\nIn early 1962, Walker campaigned to become governor of Texas and lost the Democratic primary election to the eventual winner, John Connally. In October 1962, Walker was arrested for promoting riots at the University of Mississippi in protest against the admission of black student James Meredith into the all-white university. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered Walker committed to a mental asylum for a 90-day evaluation, but the ACLU and psychiatrist Thomas Szasz protested along with rightist groups, and Walker was released in five days. Attorney Robert Morris in early 1963 convinced a Mississippi grand jury to not charge Walker with a crime.\n\nWalker reported that he was the target of an assassination attempt at his home on April 10, 1963, but escaped serious injury when a bullet fired from outside hit a window frame and fragmented. After its investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Warren Commission concluded that Walker's assailant had been Lee Harvey Oswald.[1]",
          "Early life and military career": "Walker was born in 1909 in the town of Center Point in Kerr County, Texas, in the Texas Hill Country. He graduated in 1927 from the New Mexico Military Institute. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, from which he graduated in 1931.[2]\n\nWalker's training was in artillery, but in World War II he commanded a sub-unit of the Canadian-American First Special Service Force. Walker took command of the force's 3rd Regiment while still in the United States, and commanded the regiment throughout its time in Italy. Their first combat actions began in December 1943, and after battling through the Winter Line, the force was withdrawn for redeployment to the Anzio beachhead in early 1944. After the fight for Rome in June 1944, the force was withdrawn again to prepare for Operation Dragoon. In August 1944, Walker succeeded Robert T. Frederick as the unit's second, and last, commanding officer.[3] The FSSF landed on the Islands of Hyeres off the French Riviera in the autumn of 1944, defeating a strong German garrison. Walker commanded the FSSF when it was disbanded in early 1945.[4]\n\nWalker experienced combat during the Korean War, commanding the Third Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment and serving as a senior advisor to the army of the Republic of Korea.\n\nWalker was then assigned as commander of the Arkansas Military District in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1957, he implemented an order by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to quell civil disturbances related to the desegregation of Little Rock's Central High School. Osro Cobb, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, recalls that Walker \"made it clear from the outset ... that he would do any and everything necessary to see that the black students attended Central High School as ordered by the federal court... he would arrange protection for them and their families, if necessary, and also supervise their transportation to and from the school for their safety.\"[5]\n\nWalker repeatedly protested to Eisenhower that using federal troops to enforce racial integration was against his conscience. Although he obeyed orders and successfully integrated Little Rock High School, he began listening to segregationist preacher Billy James Hargis and oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, whose anti-communist radio program Life Line was supported by conservative activist and publisher Dan Smoot. Anti-communist activists in the late 1950s claimed that communists controlled important parts of the U.S. government and the United Nations, and that some Soviet spies and agents occupied prominent jobs within the federal government.[6]\n\nIn 1959, Walker met publisher Robert Welch, the founder of the John Birch Society who taught his followers that Eisenhower was a communist and that the civil rights movement was a communist plot.[7]\n\nOn August 4, 1959, Walker submitted his resignation to the U.S. Army claiming the US government had been infiltrated by an international communist conspiracy.[citation needed] Eisenhower denied Walker's request, however, and instead offered him command of the more than 10,000 troops in Augsburg, Germany, in the 24th Infantry Division, which Walker accepted. He began promoting his \"Pro-Blue\" indoctrination program for troops, which included a reading list of materials by Hargis and the John Birch Society. The name \"Pro-Blue\", said Walker, was intended to suggest \"anti-red.\"[8] He later wrote that the Pro-Blue program was based upon his experiences in Korea, where he saw \"hastily mobilized and deployed soldiers 'bug out' in the face of Communist units with inferior equipment and often smaller numbers. American soldiers, unprepared for the psychological battlefield, needed to know why they had to beat the enemy as well as the how.\"[9]\n\nThe John Birch Society regularly claimed that all U.S. presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt onward had been communists, and Walker was quoted by the Overseas Weekly as saying that Harry S. Truman, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Secretary of State Dean Acheson were \"definitely pink.\"[citation needed] Finally, a number of soldiers had complained that Walker was instructing them how to vote in the forthcoming American election by using the Conservative Voting Index, which was biased toward the Republican Party.[10] Walker denied the allegation that he provided voting instructions to soldiers and that the allegation was based on an article in the division newspaper that provided instructions for filling out absentee ballots.[11] Walker was relieved of his command by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, while an inquiry was conducted. In October, Walker was reassigned to Hawaii to become assistant chief of staff for training and operations in the Pacific region.[citation needed]\n\nWalker decided for the second time to resign from the US Army. He was entitled to retire, but he chose instead to make a political statement. Walker chose political activism to his 30-year military career, so on November 2, 1961, Walker publicly resigned (thereby forfeiting his Army pension). President Kennedy offered Walker a new command in Hawaii instead, but Walker spurned it. Weeks later Walker said: \"It will be my purpose now, as a civilian, to attempt to do what I have found it no longer possible to do in uniform.\"[12]",
          "Political career": "During December 1961, as a civilian, Walker began a career making political speeches along with Billy James Hargis. Walker enjoyed enthusiastic crowds all over the United States and his anti-communist message was popular. He also promoted the McCarthyist belief that communists were inside the United States government. Walker's home base was Dallas, Texas, where he received considerable assistance from oil billionaire, publisher and radio host H. L. Hunt. Hunt assisted Walker's first campaign for governor of Texas. A Newsweek cover proclaimed Walker the public face of the anti-communist conservative movement.[13]\n\nIn February 1962, Walker began his campaign for governor, but finished last among six candidates in a Democratic primary election. The winner in a runoff election was John B. Connally, Jr., the choice of Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. Other contenders were Governor Price Daniel, Highway Commissioner Marshall Formby of Plainview, Attorney General of Texas Will Wilson, and Houston lawyer Don Yarborough, the favorite of liberals and organized labor. Because of disfranchisement of minorities in Texas since the beginning of the century, Democratic Party primaries were the only strongly competitive political contests in the state at that time.[14] In the course of his campaign, Walker assaulted journalist Thomas V. Kelly (father of journalist and editor Michael Kelly), who had asked him for a response to praise of Walker from American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell; Walker's response was to strike Kelly in the left eye, an attack that was widely reported in the press.[15][16]\n\nThough Walker had obeyed orders during the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, he acted privately in organizing protests in September 1962 against the enrollment of James Meredith, an African-American veteran, at the all-white University of Mississippi.\n\nOn September 26, 1962, Walker broadcast this message on several radio stations:\n\nMississippi: It is time to move. We have talked, listened and been pushed around far too much by the anti-Christ Supreme Court! Rise...to a stand beside Governor Ross Barnett at Jackson, Mississippi! Now is the time to be heard! Thousands strong from every State in the Union! Rally to the cause of freedom! The Battle Cry of the Republic! Barnett yes! Castro no! Bring your flag, your tent and your skillet. It's now or never! The time is when the President of the United States commits or uses any troops, Federal or State, in Mississippi! The last time in such a situation I was on the wrong side. That was in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957-1958. This time – out of uniform – I am on the right side! I will be there![17]\n\nOn September 29, 1962, he issued a televised statement:\n\nThis is Edwin A. Walker. I am in Mississippi beside Governor Ross Barnett. I call for a national protest against the conspiracy from within. Rally to the cause of freedom in righteous indignation, violent vocal protest, and bitter silence under the flag of Mississippi at the use of Federal troops. This today is a disgrace to the nation in \"dire peril\", a disgrace beyond the capacity of anyone except its enemies. This is the conspiracy of the crucifixion by anti-Christ conspirators of the Supreme Court in their denial of prayer and their betrayal of a nation.[18]\n\nWhite segregationists from around the state joined students and locals in a violent, 15-hour riot on the campus on September 30. Two people were killed execution-style, hundreds were wounded, and six federal marshals were shot. Walker was arrested on four federal charges, including sedition and insurrection against the United States. He was temporarily detained in a mental institution on orders from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who demanded that Walker receive a 90-day psychiatric examination.[19]\n\nThe attorney general's decision was challenged by noted psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, who insisted that psychiatry must never become used for political rivalry. The American Civil Liberties Union joined Szasz in a protest against the attorney general, completing this coalition of liberal and conservative leaders. The attorney general had to relent, and Walker spent only five days in the asylum.[20]\n\nWalker posted bond and returned home to Dallas, where he was greeted by a crowd of some 200 devotees.[21] After a federal grand jury adjourned in January 1963 without indicting him, the charges were dismissed. Because the dismissal of the charges was without prejudice, the charges could have been reinstated within five years.[22]",
          "Warren Commission": "In February 1963, Walker joined Billy James Hargis on an anticommunist tour named \"Operation Midnight Ride.\"[23] In a March 5 speech, Walker called on the American military to \"liquidate the [communist] scourge that has descended upon the island of Cuba.\"[24] Seven days later, Lee Harvey Oswald ordered a Carcano rifle by mail using the alias A. Hidell.[25]\n\nWhile initially skeptical about the photographic evidence provided by the FBI, the Warren Commission reported that Oswald photographed Walker's Dallas home on the weekend of March 9–10, 1963.[26] Oswald's friend, 51-year-old Russian émigré and petroleum geologist George de Mohrenschildt,[27] would later tell the Warren Commission that he \"knew that Oswald disliked General Walker.\"[28]\n\nOn April 10, 1963, as Walker was sitting at a desk in his dining room, a bullet struck the wooden frame of his dining-room window. Walker was injured in the forearm by fragments. Marina Oswald later testified that her husband had told her that he traveled by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle.[29][30] Marina said Oswald considered Walker to be the leader of a \"fascist organization.\"[31]\n\nPolice detective D. E. McElroy commented, \"Whoever shot at the general was playing for keeps. The sniper wasn't trying to scare him. He was shooting to kill.\" The bullet was too badly damaged to provide conclusive ballistics tests, but neutron activation analysis tests later determined that it was \"extremely likely\" that the bullet was manufactured by the Western Cartridge Company and was the same type of ammunition as was used in the Kennedy assassination.[32]\n\nA note that Oswald left for Marina on the night of the attempt with instructions for her should he not return was not found until ten days after the assassination.[33][34][35] Marina Oswald stated later that she had seen Oswald burn most of his plans in the bathtub, though she hid the note that he had left for her in a cookbook, with the intention of bringing it to the police should Oswald again attempt to kill Walker or anyone else. Marina later quoted her husband as saying, \"Well, what would you say if somebody got rid of Hitler at the right time? So if you don't know about General Walker, how can you speak up on his behalf?\"[36]\n\nThe Warren Commission questioned Walker about an interview that he had granted on November 22 in Shreveport, Louisiana that appeared in the November 29, 1963 edition of the extreme-right German newspaper Deutsche National-Zeitung, in which Walker accused Oswald of having attempted to kill him.[37] Marina Oswald was asked about the report during a two-week-long detention in which she was interrogated by federal investigators, and she said that she believed that the report was true.\n\nWalker organized an October 24, 1963, UN Day attack on Adlai Stevenson, American ambassador to the United Nations, in Dallas. In mid-October 1963, Walker rented the same Dallas Memorial Auditorium in which Stevenson would later speak. He promoted his opposition event as \"US Day\" and he invited members of the John Birch Society, the National Indignation Convention, the Minutemen and other organizations opposed to communism and the United Nations.[38]\n\nThe verbal attacks on Stevenson were traced to plans organized by Walker and his devotees in the John Birch Society, according to the November issue of the magazine Texas Observer. On November 22, a black-bordered advertisement ran in the Dallas Morning News and \"Wanted for Treason: JFK\" handbills appeared on the streets. They were traced to Walker and his associate Robert Surrey by the Warren Commission. After the assassination, Walker wrote and spoke publicly about his belief that there were two assassins at the \"April Crime\", Oswald and another person who was never found.\n\nImmediately after the Warren Commission released its report in September 1964, Walker described it as a \"farcical whitewash.\"[39] Although he accepted the commission's finding that it had been Oswald who had shot at him the previous year, Walker claimed that the commission was attempting to hide \"some sort of conspiracy\" that included an association between Jack Ruby and Oswald.[40]",
          "Associated Press v. Walker": "Angered by negative publicity, Walker began to file libel lawsuits against various media outlets. One suit responded to negative coverage of his role in the riot at the University of Mississippi protesting Meredith's admission. The Associated Press reported that Walker had \"led a charge of students against federal marshals\" and that he had \"assumed command of the crowd.\"[41] Several newspapers were named in the lawsuit. If successful, Walker could have been awarded tens of millions of dollars. A 1964 Texas trial court found the statements to be false and defamatory. By then, Walker and his lawyers had already been awarded more than $3 million from other lawsuits.[42]\n\nThe Associated Press appealed the decision as Associated Press v. Walker, eventually to the United States Supreme Court,[43] where it was consolidated with Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled against Walker and found that although the statements might have been false, the Associated Press was not guilty of reckless disregard in its reporting about Walker. The court, which had previously said that public officials could not recover damages unless they could prove malice, extended it to public figures as well.",
          "Arrest and conviction": "By resigning instead of retiring, Walker became ineligible for an Army pension. He made statements at the time to the Dallas Morning News that he had \"refused\" his pension. However, he had made several previous requests for his pension dating back to 1973. The army restored his pension rights in 1982.[44]\n\nWalker, at age 66, was arrested on June 23, 1976, for fondling and propositioning a male undercover police officer in a public restroom in a Dallas park and charged with public lewdness.[45][46][47] He was arrested again in Dallas for public lewdness on March 16, 1977.[48][49] He pleaded no contest to one of the two misdemeanor charges, and was convicted and sentenced to jail time, which the judge suspended. He was also fined $1,000.[50]\n\nWalker, a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer at his home in Dallas on Halloween 1993, ten days before his 84th birthday.[51] He was never married and did not have any children.",
          "Media presentations": "Together with Air Force general Curtis LeMay, Walker was said to have inspired the character of the Air Force general James Mattoon Scott (played by Burt Lancaster) of the movie Seven Days in May; Walker is also referred to in the movie.[52][53]\nWalker was said to have inspired the character of General Jack D.

          "Lead": "Mary Andre Dubose Barton\nVirginia Ledgerwood\n\nMary Andre Dubose Barton\n\nVirginia Ledgerwood\n\nMalcolm Everett \"Mac\" Wallace (October 15, 1921 – January 7, 1971) was an American economist for the United States Department of Agriculture.[1][2][3] On October 22, 1951, Wallace fatally shot John Douglas Kinser in the clubhouse of an Austin golf course owned by Kinser.[3] A number of authors claim Wallace was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy upon orders from then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.",
          "Early life": "Wallace was a native of Mount Pleasant, Texas.[4] He was the son of Alvin James Wallace, Sr. (1895-1973), a cement and construction contractor, according to the 1930 US Census, and Alice Marie Riddle (1897-1959).[citation needed] In 1939, Wallace graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas.[5] After high school, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in November 1939.[4][6] While in the Marine Corps, he was assigned to the USS Lexington, but was discharged on September 25, 1940, after reinjuring his back.\n\nAfter his discharge from the Marine Corps, he attended the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the Tejas Club, Texas Cowboys, and the president of the student body.[2][4][7][6] He led a 1944 protest against the ouster of UT president Homer P. Rainey and graduated in 1947.[4] Wallace was also a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Columbia University, from September 1947 to May 1948 but did not graduate with a degree.[citation needed] By early August 1951, Wallace was working as an economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. while his wife, a draftsman with the Planning Survey Division Texas Department of Transportation, and children lived with his mother in Austin.[6] A contemporary account in The Daily Texan reported that Wallace had been separated from his wife, Andre, since August 3.[8] In October 1951, Wallace was visiting Austin and Dallas while on vacation from his position in Washington.[6]",
          "Murder of John Douglas Kinser": "On October 22, 1951, in Austin, John Douglas Kinser, a 33-year-old sophomore student at the University of Texas who was having an affair with Wallace's estranged wife, was shot to death in the clubhouse of the Pitch and Putt Golf Course that he operated.[9][10] Immediately after the first shot, one golfer outside the clubhouse observed a man inside holding a revolver.[9] He heard two or three additional shots after leaving to attract the attention of three other golfers on the course.[9] The three golfers on the course observed the man running from the clubhouse and getting into his car, and one of them noted the car's make and license plate number.[9] The men ran to the clubhouse where they found Kinser's body, then telephoned the police who radioed the car's description and license information to state and city patrol cars.[9] Three patrolmen with the Texas Highway Patrol spotted then stopped the car nine miles from Austin on the Burnet Highway.[9] According to one of the patrolmen, the driver perfectly fit the description provided by the golfers and his shirt was torn and bloodied.[9] The suspect and witness were taken to the headquarters of the Austin Police Department for questioning.[9]\n\nWallace was identified as the man leaving the scene with a snubnosed pistol, and three bullet shells were found near Kinser's body.[6] He was arrested by highway patrolmen on the Burnet Highway shortly after the shooting.[6] Detectives revealed no motive in the killing as Wallace refused to answer their questions.[6] He was charged the following day with murder and the Justice of the peace set bail at $30,000.[6]\n\nTwo days after the killing, the district attorney accused the local sheriff of \"obstructing the investigation\" stating that he had refused to transport Wallace to the Texas Department of Public Safety for identification testing.[11] According to the sheriff, Wallace protested the move and his defense attorney, Polk Shelton, had asked that Wallace not be moved.[11] Wallace was represented at the trial by John Cofer, longtime lawyer to Lyndon Johnson, who had also represented LBJ during his contested election to the United States Senate in 1948 that was tainted by allegations of voter fraud.[12]\n\nDuring the trial, FBI special agent Joseph L. Schott stated that he had known Wallace for 12 years and in 1946 had given Wallace a German-made 6.35 mm Schmeisser automatic pistol that he (Schott) had acquired while serving in the United States Army in Germany.[13] A firearms expert for the Department of Public Safety testified that the slugs and shells from the murder scene could have been fired from the Schmeisser.[13] A chemist/toxicology expert, also with the Department of Public Safety, said that a paraffin test on Wallace's hands tested positive for gunshot residue and that blood on his shirt matched blood found at the club house at the golf course.[13]\n\nTestimony was completed on February 25, 1952, and Judge Charles O' Betts recessed court in order to finalize the jury instructions prior to closing arguments.[14] The prosecution did not attempt to establish a motive for the shooting, nor did it produce an eyewitness to it or the murder weapon.[14] The following day, the prosecution and defense completed their closing arguments and the jury was charged that afternoon.[15][nb 1] After deliberating into the evening, the jury was sequestered within the courthouse dormitory.[15] After listening to 29.5 hours of testimony from 23 different witnesses, on February 27 the jury returned its verdict finding Wallace guilty of \"murder with malice\".[16] After a short recess, O' Betts sentenced Wallace to a five-year sentence that was suspended.[12][16] Questioned as to why the prosecution did not attempt to provide a motive, defense attorney Polk Shelton stated that they were not required to establish a motive but it was \"probably because they couldn't.\"[16]",
          "Later life": "Wallace was the manager of the purchasing department of Ling-Temco-Vought.[4] He attended an Episcopal church in Dallas.[4]\n\nOn January 7, 1971, Wallace died when his car ran off the road 3.5 miles south of Pittsburg, Texas on U.S. Route 271.[4] Noting that the highway was neither icy nor wet, the investigating patrolman stated that Wallace had struck a bridge abutment after apparently losing control of his car.[17] He was buried in the Nevills Chapel Cemetery in Mount Pleasant.[4]",
          "Posthumous allegations": "In 1984, Billie Sol Estes told a grand jury investigating the 1961 shooting death of Henry Marshall, an official with the Department of Agriculture, that Wallace was his murderer.[2] Estes, a long-time conman who served two prison terms for his crimes, said that Marshall possessed information linking Estes's fraudulent schemes to a heavily funded political slush fund run by Lyndon B. Johnson.[2][18] According to Estes, he and Johnson discussed the need to stop Marshall from making their illegal ties public.[2] In exchange for immunity from prosecution, Estes was also prepared to provide the United States Department of Justice information of eight killings orchestrated by Johnson, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[18] He claimed that Wallace persuaded Jack Ruby to recruit Lee Harvey Oswald and that Wallace fired a shot that struck Kennedy.[18]\n\nGlen Sample and Mark Collom implicated Wallace in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy in their mid-1990s book The Men on the Sixth Floor.[19] According to the authors, Collom met Loy Factor while confined in a hospital isolation ward in 1971 where Factor implicated himself, Wallace, and a woman named \"Ruth Ann\" in the assassination of Kennedy.[19] Conspiracy debunker Dave Perry charged the authors of relying upon unreliable witnesses, including Factor, Estes, and Madeleine Duncan Brown.[20]\n\nBarr McClellan, author of Blood, Money & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK, reiterated many of Estes's claims in 2003 stating that Johnson, Wallace, Estes, and Cliff Carter were responsible for the death of Marshall.[21] According to McClellan, Wallace fired one shot at Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, then ran and escaped.[21] He stated that fingerprints and an eyewitness placed Wallace in that location and that Wallace could be seen as a \"shadowy figure\" in photos of the building. However Wallace's fingerprints were never mentioned by the Dallas PD to have been found near or around Oswald's snipers Nest. [21] In their 2003 obituary of Estes, the New York Times wrote that none of Estes's claims against LBJ were backed by evidence.[18]\n\nRoger Stone, author of the 2013 book The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ, called Wallace \"Lyndon Johnson's personal hit man\" and also said that Wallace shot Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.[22] Similar to McClellan's account, Stone said six eyewitnesses placed Wallace in that location and that a fingerprint found on a box in the sniper's nest was his.[22]\n\nDescribing Wallace as Johnson's \"hatchet man\", Joan Mellen's 2017 book Faustian Bargains: Lyndon Johnson and Mac Wallace in the Robber Baron Culture of Texas also suggests that Wallace killed Marshall upon the behest of Johnson.[23][24]\n\n^ The Daily Texan wrote: \"The jury can acquit Wallace or render a verdict of from two to five years—or death. If it renders from two to five years, then it can also suspend the sentence, but if the verdict is over five years it cannot suspend the sentence.\"[15]\n\n^ The Daily Texan wrote: \"The jury can acquit Wallace or render a verdict of from two to five years—or death. If it renders from two to five years, then it can also suspend the sentence, but if the verdict is over five years it cannot suspend the sentence.\"[15]\n\n^ \"Murder at the Butler Pitch and Putt - News - Austin American-Statesman - Austin, TX\".

He later did postgraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Harold Edgerton, graduating from MIT in 1941. After World War II he worked with Edgerton to develop techniques to photograph atomic experiments in the Pacific Ocean. With little resources in the field, he solved chronic fogging problems during tests in the Marshall Islands in 1954, thus saving the entire photographic record of the project.[2] He was later engaged by CBS to analyze the famous Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination.[3] In 1975, with Edgerton and Robert Rines he made headlines by allegedly photographing the Loch Ness monster.[4]\n\nHe was a Life Fellow of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.[5] In 1967, he was made a Fellow of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology.[6]\n\n^ Obituary Archived August 20, 2009, at the Wayback Machine\n^ Martin L.
